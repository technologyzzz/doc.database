### LYING WITH STATISTICS
* Predictive analytics can uncover deeply personal information from seemingly innocuous data, as demonstrated by Target's algorithm that identified pregnant customers based on their shopping habits.
* Statistics are frequently misused to create misleading narratives without technically lying, by exploiting common fallacies, framing data deceptively, and confusing correlation with causation.
* The misuse of statistical reasoning in the legal system, such as the Prosecutor's Fallacy and assuming independent events, can have devastating real-world consequences, leading to wrongful convictions.
* The way data is framed (e.g., relative vs. absolute increase) and grouped (Simpson's Paradox) can completely reverse a conclusion, even when using factually correct numbers.

1.  **Predictive statistics can uncover sensitive personal information from behavioral data.**
    a. The Target pregnancy prediction model
    •   Around 2002, Target asked a statistician, Andrew Pole, to determine which customers were pregnant using only their shopping data.
    •   He analyzed shopping patterns and noticed common behaviors among expectant mothers, like an increase in lotion and vitamin purchases.
    b. The algorithm's capability
    •   The model could not only determine likely pregnancies but also estimate the due date and trimester.
    •   Target used this information to send timely coupons for baby-related items over several months.
    c. Managing the reveal
    •   To avoid alarming customers, Target sprinkled baby-related coupons in with other unrelated product offers to make them seem more natural.
    d. A real-world incident
    •   An angry father confronted a Minnesota Target manager after his high school daughter received coupons for diapers and cribs.
    •   The manager later called to apologize again, but the father, now embarrassed, admitted he had just learned his daughter was indeed pregnant.
    •   The statistical algorithm figured out the girl was pregnant before her own father knew.

2.  **Statistical probabilities have been powerfully, yet controversially, used in criminal justice.**
    a. The case of Janet and Malcolm Collins
    •   In 1964, an elderly woman's purse was stolen by a person witnesses described as a blonde woman with a ponytail who fled in a yellow car driven by a black man with a beard and a mustache.
    •   Police arrested Janet and Malcolm Collins, who matched all descriptions.
    •   A mathematician testified, calculating the probability of a randomly selected innocent couple sharing all these characteristics.
    •   The joint probability was calculated to be less than a 1 in 12 million chance that a couple fitting the descriptions was innocent, leading the jury to a guilty verdict.
    b. The case of Sally Clark
    •   Sally Clark was found guilty of murdering her two infant sons in the 90s.
    •   Her first son died suddenly in 1996 from what was assumed to be SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome).
    •   About a year later, her second son was found dead 8 weeks after his birth, again from unknown causes.
    •   During the trial, a pediatrician professor testified that the chance of two infants dying from SIDS in this manner was about 1 in 73 million.
    •   Based on this statistic being "beyond a reasonable doubt," she was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.

3.  **Statistics can be easily manipulated to mislead without using false data.**
    a. Speaker's admission
    •   Statistics has a lot of power in our world, whether it be advertising or criminal cases.
    •   However, what's also powerful and easier to do is to lie, mislead, and misinform using statistics.
    •   I've already done that multiple times in this video.

4.  **Misleading survey design and framing can create factually true but deceptive claims.**
    a. Deceptive advertising claims
    •   In 2007, a Colgate ad in the UK claimed "80% of dentists recommend Colgate."
    •   The UK's Advertising Standard Authority ordered them to abandon the claim because it was misleading.
    •   The study allowed dentists to recommend more than one toothpaste brand.
    •   While 80% did recommend Colgate, a hypothetical scenario shows 100% could have recommended Crest, but Colgate's claim remains technically true.
    b. Framing with relative vs. absolute increases
    •   A high school dropout rate going from 5% to 10% can be framed as a 5% increase (absolute) or a 100% increase (relative).
    •   If the rate goes from 1 in a million (.0001%) to 2 in a million (.0002%), it is both a .0001% increase and a 100% increase.
    •   The "100% increase" headline makes the problem seem much worse than it is if the absolute numbers are very small.
    c. A real-world example: The birth control scare
    •   In 1995, the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines warned a certain birth control pill increased the risk of blood clots by 100%.
    •   This meant the risk went from 1 in 7,000 women (about .014%) to 2 in 7,000 women (about .028%).
    •   This misleading statistic was widely reported, causing thousands of women to stop taking the pill.
    •   One year later, the scare was blamed for 13,000 unwanted pregnancies.

5.  **Confusing correlation with causation is a common method of statistical misinterpretation.**
    a. Mistaking the direction of causality
    •   It is easy to determine correlation from a statistical test, but causation is completely different.
    •   The belief that head lice were good for health came from observing that healthy people had lice while sick people (with fevers) did not. In reality, the lice left hosts with high body temperatures.
    •   The question of whether violent TV shows cause kids to be violent, or if violent kids are just more likely to watch violent shows, illustrates this ambiguity.
    b. The third cause fallacy
    •   This occurs when two correlated events are both caused by a third factor.
    •   Ice cream sales are correlated with heat strokes, but both are caused by hot weather.
    •   Atmospheric CO2 has increased along with obesity levels, but both are likely caused by richer populations that eat more and produce more CO2.
    c. Ambiguous causality
    •   Sometimes it's very unclear what is causing what.
    •   Students who smoke cigarettes get lower grades. This could mean smoking causes lower grades, or that the stress of getting bad grades causes smoking, or a third factor is responsible for both.

6.  **Failing to properly group data can lead to paradoxical and incorrect conclusions.**
    a. The concept of Simpson's Paradox
    •   Looking at data as a whole can tell a totally different story than grouping the data appropriately.
    b. The Berkeley graduate school admissions case
    •   In the 1970s, data showed Berkeley accepted 44% of male applicants but only 35% of female applicants, suggesting a bias against women. (A sound effect of a crowd was noted here by the speaker) (Reference to a missing audio component).
    •   However, when broken down by department, the apparent bias not only disappeared but flipped.
    •   Women had higher acceptance rates in some of the most competitive programs, but a much lower percentage of women applied to those programs.
    •   A higher percentage of women applied to programs with much lower acceptance rates for everyone, guaranteeing a lower overall acceptance rate for women.
    c. The power to shape a narrative
    •   With this data, one could publish a headline claiming bias or a headline debunking it, and use cleverly selected statistics to back up either story.

7.  **Fundamental logical errors in probability, such as the Prosecutor's Fallacy, lead to wrongful convictions.**
    a. The Prosecutor's Fallacy explained
    •   This fallacy occurs when people assume that the probability of A given B, $P(A|B)$, is the same as the probability of B given A, $P(B|A)$.
    •   The chance of an animal having four legs *given* it's a dog is almost 100%. The chance of an animal being a dog *given* it has four legs is much lower.
    b. Debunking the Collins case
    •   The case was a famous example of the *misuse* of statistics.
    •   The statistic showed that *given an innocent couple*, the odds they fit the descriptions was 1 in 12 million.
    •   The jury wrongly assumed this meant that *given a couple who fits the descriptions*, the odds of them being innocent was 1 in 12 million. This is the fallacy.
    •   The correct question is: given a couple fits the descriptions, what is the probability they are guilty? If 10 couples in the city fit the description, there is a 9 in 10 chance a random one is innocent.
    c. Debunking the Sally Clark case
    •   This is also a famous case of the misuse of statistics.
    •   Bacterial tests that could have revealed more specific information were withheld.
    •   The 1 in 73 million calculation incorrectly assumed the two deaths were independent events, ignoring potential genetic or environmental factors.
    •   Sally Clark's conviction was overturned after she served three years in prison.
    •   She was never able to recover mentally from the false accusation, developed psychiatric problems, and died from alcohol poisoning in 2007.
    •   This case prompted a review of hundreds of other similar cases.

8.  **Manipulating data visualization is a common technique to distort perception.**
    a. The non-zero baseline issue
    •   A classic misuse of statistics is using bar graphs that do not have zero as their baseline.
    b. Media and government examples
    •   A Fox News chart on the expiration of Bush tax cuts made a ~15% increase look like several hundred percent by starting the y-axis at 34%.
    •   A CNN poll on the Terri Schiavo case made the difference in opinion between political parties look significantly larger than it was.
    •   A 2015 White House tweet used a misleading graphic that made a ~10% increase in high school diploma recipients look like a nearly 200% increase.
    •   A music chart showing views between top artists made Drake's ~5% lead look like a very large margin.

9.  **The real-world application of statistics is complex and can be used to shape narratives.**
    a. Final thoughts
    •   These numbers can change the way we think about a person.
    •   They can peek into the most intimate moments of our lives based on our grocery list.
    •   They can make trivial events seem serious and vice versa, often without using wrong numbers.
    •   This shows how not cut and dry math and statistics can be in the real world outside of a school setting.
