### Key Insights
* Effective thinking is not the brain's natural state; it is the disciplined act of overriding automatic pattern-matching to deal with the reality of a situation, especially when navigating dynamic complexity.
* The most effective problem-solving approach is "right-to-left" and "top-down," starting with the desired outcome and working backward, in contrast to the more common but less effective "left-to-right" data-gathering method.
* The Situation-Implication-Proposal (SIP) framework is a powerful tool for structuring both thinking and communication, forcing clarity by articulating the context, its consequences, and a clear call to action.
* Deeply understanding your audience—their knowledge, motivations, and potential objections—is the most critical element of preparation, enabling you to tailor the message for maximum impact and alignment.

1.  **This course provides a structured methodology for mastering management consulting presentations.**
    a. The value of presentation skills
    • Designing presentations is perhaps the most required skill for workers, sales executives, entrepreneurs, and educators.
    • They are one of the most popular business communication tools, second only to email, used to attract clients and keep employees on track.
    • My name is John Burris, and I've designed more than a thousand management consulting presentations.
    • Learning to craft, build, and deliver these presentations is a skill you have to continuously improve upon to succeed.
    b. Course scope and methodology
    • I'll show you how to build a McKinsey-style presentation from scratch.
    • We will cover techniques widely used in McKinsey, BCG, and Bain.
    • The course will follow a simple but powerful structure: Plan Do Check Act (PDCA).
    • This framework covers the full cycle, from planning a storyline and creating data visualizations to setting up a meeting room and managing presentation nerves.

2.  **Consulting presentations are meticulously structured to force brevity and communicate complex ideas effectively.**
    a. Addressing the misconception of "pretty" slides
    • Consultants spend hours on slides, which can seem excessive or narcissistic to a casual observer.
    • Presentations are also called "deliverables" because they are the products we deliver to clients.
    • I've heard the comment "you're so good at making pretty presentations," and it drives me a bit crazy.
    • The aesthetic part is the equivalent of choosing the garnish for pasta or the jacket design for a book.
    • A client paying $250 to $500 per billable hour isn't paying for "presentation jockeys."
    b. The core functions of a presentation
    • **First, it forces brevity:** Good presentations are succinct, boiling down endless analysis to its essence using the 80/20 principle.
    • **Second, executives are short on time:** An executive sponsor might only commit 10-12 total hours for a three-month project; they won't read a 100-page document.
    • **Third, communication is the goal:** Consultants are hired to solve problems, which means persuading people to take action, and results are needed.
    • **Fourth, executives are visual people:** Graphs, tables, lists, and diagrams help convey a lot of information in a concise way.

3.  **Management consulting focuses on providing actionable insights to improve organizational performance.**
    a. Defining the role of a management consultant
    • Management consulting focuses on supporting and guiding management to improve the performance of their organizations.
    • This applies to the private sector as well as governments and non-profit organizations.
    • The aim is to provide practical insights and solutions which management can act on.
    b. The skillset of a consultant
    • Firms focus on hiring the brightest people they can find—problem solvers who can adapt.
    • Superb communication skills are essential for working with clients daily.
    • Consultants collect information, find insights, and then explain their conclusions to clients.
    • A typical day may involve meeting clients, analyzing data, and creating PowerPoints to clearly convey their work.

4.  **A consulting project follows a six-phase lifecycle where presentations are a continuous communication tool.**
    a. The collaborative nature of projects
    • A consulting project can last for weeks, months, or even years.
    • It's a collaborative process between a client and a team of consultants to solve key problems.
    • The value is not just the external analysis but also the assessment of what outcomes may happen if a plan is implemented.
    b. Phase 1: Defining the problem
    • This is the most critical stage; an incorrect definition can lead to months of futile work.
    • A good consultant will differentiate problem symptoms from causes and work with the client to redefine the project scope.
    c. Phase 2: Structuring the problem
    • The question is broken down into more manageable chunks for analysis.
    • A structure might look like a driver tree, issue tree, or hypothesis tree.
    d. Phase 3: Developing a hypothesis
    • From the start, the team forms a hypothesis about the cause and effect of the problem.
    • The project plan will be designed to answer key questions that either prove or disprove this initial hypothesis.
    e. Phase 4: Building a work plan
    • The work plan is a key internal tool to manage the project and make time estimates more realistic.
    • It's a functional, not a "pretty," document that provides a framework for the entire project.
    f. Phase 5: Conducting analysis
    • This involves extensive interviews with senior management and in-depth research of industry and market trends.
    • At larger firms, consultants use their global network to identify similar past projects to get a bigger picture.
    g. Phase 6: Synthesis and recommendation
    • The final presentation summarizes the efforts, results, implications, and recommendations.
    • Being able to take complex information and boil it down to straightforward presentations is a core skill consultants develop.
    • We use slides throughout the project for executive updates, focus interviews, and internal alignment, not just in the final phase.
    • Consultants will spend at least 40% of their time on creating the storyline, headlines, and finding data for their presentations.

5.  **The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle provides a repeatable process for developing high-quality presentations.**
    a. The importance of a defined process
    • Presentations play a main role in how a client views project deliverables.
    • A bad presentation can lead to damage to you and your firm's reputation.
    • The key is to have a process in place to plan, test, and incorporate feedback as you develop the presentation.
    b. The Plan phase
    • We plan the overall presentation logic, craft key messages, and create a storyline.
    • This gives us the structure for the deck without investing time yet to create PowerPoint pages.
    c. The Do phase
    • We get down to creating our presentation.
    • I'll explain how to build the cover, agenda, headline, body, kicker, and every element.
    d. The Check phase
    • You're looking to measure how effective the "do" stage was.
    • We'll explore a set of checking points to ensure the final work is ready for the client.
    e. The Act phase
    • This is when you need to finalize the presentation fully.
    • We'll go through techniques to give an extraordinary presentation.

6.  **Each consulting slide is constructed with distinct building blocks to convey a clear, actionable message.**
    a. The headline or title
    • Unlike general titles like "Financial Analysis," a headline from an elite firm is usually a full sentence that captures the key takeaway and guides the reader to an action.
    • Font size and position should be consistent; in my firm, 24-point Calibri is preferred.
    • Microsoft changed its default font to Calibri to modernize documents, and font psychology research associates it with stability, which clients love.
    b. The body
    • The primary types of body content are words, tables, and graphs.
    • Management consultants use graphics a lot to reinforce key messages because a picture means a thousand words.
    • I saw many junior consultants insert irrelevant graphics for aesthetic reasons, but the body should always support your main idea.
    • When you have data analysis, be sure to include the info source for credibility and copyright.
    c. The kicker
    • A kicker is used at the bottom of a slide to conclude key takeaways or make a smooth transition to the next slide.
    • You can find kickers on almost every page of a McKinsey-style presentation, but it's not mandatory.

7.  **Effective presentation storylines rely on self-explanatory headlines organized with both horizontal and vertical logic.**
    a. The critical role of headlines
    • When a partner first reviews your slides, they will be looking at the storyboard and focusing on the headlines.
    • The headline should say exactly what you want to say and provide insight to the reader.
    • A very important rule to remember is that headlines should be self-explanatory; if you have to explain what it means, it doesn't work.
    b. The "stand-alone" principle
    • The slide must be able to speak for itself and be a stand-alone document.
    • Test this by considering if the key message would be conveyed if no one was doing a voice-over.
    • It can be intimidating for young consultants who want to provide all the background info, but if you have to present that, something is wrong with your presentation.
    c. Horizontal and vertical logic
    • **Horizontal logic:** One headline should lead to the next headline, which leads to another. As the reader scans just the headlines, they see a message developing.
    • **Vertical logic:** The body and data on the slide must directly support what the headline is saying.
    • In this example (Reference to a missing visual example), the slides provide the "bottom line up front" message that the international post is already well-diversified.
    • The first slide shows the majority of revenue is from non-mail, and the second reveals which entities are in the sample.
    • You want your audience to know where the final destination is and how they will get there.

8.  **The MECE principle is critical for structuring information logically, ensuring thoroughness without confusion.**
    a. Defining MECE
    • In a management consulting presentation, the vertical and horizontal logic must be MECE: Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive.
    • The principle suggests that all options for solving a problem should be grouped into categories with no overlap (mutually exclusive) and that all categories added together cover all possible options (collectively exhaustive).
    b. An example of a non-MECE structure
    • Grouping customers by their hobbies is not MECE, as a customer may appear in more than one hobby category.
    c. An example of a MECE structure
    • Grouping customers by age group is MECE because no individual can be in more than one category (mutually exclusive), and the groups as a whole cover the entire population (collectively exhaustive).
    d. Applying MECE to mechanisms and concepts
    • **Formulas:** `Profits = Revenues - Costs` is a MECE framework. Revenue components don't appear in costs (ME), and together they fully explain profit movements (CE).
    • **Conceptual Data:** When asked "Should I enter X market?", a consultant might analyze "financial factors" and "non-financial factors." These categories are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.
    e. How to check for MECE in your presentation
    • When you finish your headlines, use a whiteboard to write them down.
    • Check if each slide can fit into only one key message at a time (the ME part).
    • Ensure you haven't left anything out that the audience would expect you to cover (the CE part).

9.  **Storyboarding is a visual planning technique to structure a presentation's logic before building slides.**
    a. The origin and concept
    • The concept was developed by Walt Disney Productions during the early 1930s to pre-visualize a movie.
    • In consulting, storyboards act as a fast way to set up a presentation in a structured manner and check the story for logic and consistency.
    • The consulting team needs to set up an account of their message so everybody in the group can comprehend the reasoning and give criticism.
    b. The storyboarding process
    • A key tip on visuals: Don't start designing slides first. Before you open PowerPoint, take out a notepad and start sketching.
    • Think of each page in two simple chunks: the key message and the body (your analysis to support the key message).
    • The theme for the presentation should be the thread that holds all points and stories together in one uniform message.
    c. A two-step outlining method
    • **First, define the function or objective:** For example, "we need to reduce cost by 10% with three solutions."
    • Detail each solution with sub-points, such as "Solution one: The new procedure reduces cost by 5%."
    • **Second, write down the summary:** Validate that cost can be reduced by 10% with the three new solutions.
    • When first creating your outline, expect holes and sections that need more information; capture what you can and then go back to refine it.

10. **The dot-dash outline, or ghost deck, is an efficient text-based method for getting early feedback on the storyline.**
    a. Defining the dot-dash format
    • It refers to a bullet point outline format used to structure the storyline.
    • Main, top-level ideas that drive the storyline are designated with round dot-shaped bullet points.
    • Second-level supporting ideas, facts, and exhibits are indented and designated with dashes.
    b. The strategic value of an outline
    • The entire storyline can be laid out without investing the time to create full PowerPoint slides.
    • This allows you to find out if changes are needed before significant resources are spent.
    • This outline is sometimes known as a "ghost deck," which is reviewed by key stakeholders for early feedback.
    c. The importance of early feedback
    • If you create a full PowerPoint and the feedback is that the storyline is wrong, you have wasted time that you and your client can't get back.
    • By providing a simple dot-dash outline, you get valuable lessons about the deck's structure at minimal cost.
    • This approach is only effective if you do it early and get quick feedback from stakeholders to correct the course if necessary.

11. **Prioritizing content over formatting is essential during the initial drafting process.**
    a. The trap of premature formatting
    • Formatting can be a tempting distraction that feels productive but often leads to procrastination.
    • Adjusting margins, tweaking font sizes, or playing with bold and italic text consumes time and disrupts the thought process.
    • My own experience shows that I fell into the common trap of excessive tinkering, which might have looked pleasing but did not enhance the quality of the writing.
    b. The productive role of structure
    • The essence of good writing lies in the clarity of your ideas, not the elegance of your document's layout.
    • A clear structure, such as an outline with simple headings, can serve as a helpful guide to maintain focus.
    • The takeaway is to prioritize your ideas, write freely, embrace the roughness of a first draft, and save detailed formatting for later.

12. **The Pyramid Principle provides a top-down structure for communication that begins with the answer first.**
    a. Core tenets of the principle
    • It is a methodology for structured communication used at McKinsey, where the message must be crisp for busy executives.
    • The key points are: 1) Begin with the answer. 2) Group and summarize your supporting arguments. 3) Logically order your supporting ideas.
    b. The "Answer First" approach
    • This top-down structure may seem counterintuitive, as many of us are taught to build up to a conclusion.
    • At McKinsey, "Start with the answer first" was a must. If an executive asked, "What should we do?" the consultant should reply, "You should do X."
    c. Justification for "Answer First"
    • **You maximize time:** You satisfy the executive's desire for an answer and can then focus on the details they care most about.
    • **It's safer:** An "Answer First" approach lets your audience correct you immediately if you've made a terrible mistake, saving everyone's time. In my view, leading an audience to the wrong message after ten minutes of analysis is much worse.
    • **It matches their thinking:** Executives tend to think with a top-down approach; this format matches their mental model.
    • **It's more persuasive:** Being direct makes you sound more assertive and confident.
    d. Grouping arguments with the Rule of Three
    • Ideas should always form a pyramid under a single thought (the answer).
    • The magic number of ideas in a group is three, known as the Rule of Three.
    • Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer used groups of three no fewer than five times in one presentation to make complex technology easier to follow.
    e. Logically ordering ideas
    • **Time order:** Use for a sequence of events that form a cause-effect relationship.
    • **Structural order:** Break a singular thought down into its component parts.
    • **Degree order:** Present supporting ideas in rank order of importance, from most to least important.
    f. An illustrative example of the principle
    • The root node of the situation is this slide (Reference to a missing visual slide) and its only child node is this one (Reference to a missing visual slide), a summary node outlining three root causes.
    • The audience's natural question is "Why are revenues declining?" The MECE root causes must consider changes in pricing and volume.
    • The next slide in the series (Reference to a missing visual slide) explores these two factors.
    • As shown here (Reference to a missing visual slide), the shortfall is due to two factors: the economic recession and e-diversion.

13. **True thinking requires overcoming the brain's natural pattern matching to navigate complexity.**
    a. The purpose of thinking
    • No one knows exactly what thinking is, but its purpose is to stop thinking.
    • The brain is a pattern recognition machine that simplifies life by setting up routine patterns, like getting dressed in the morning without consciously sorting through 47,000 combinations.
    • This automatic response is pattern matching, not thinking.
    b. The discipline of true thinking
    • True thinking is restraining natural impulses to deal with what is actually in front of you, not what your perception, skills, and experience suggest is there.
    • A Japanese proverb says: "Man thinks. When he gets tired, he says, 'I understand.'" This highlights our tendency to stop thinking prematurely.
    c. The two forms of complexity
    • **Detail complexity:** Involves a sheer number of variables, like a large spreadsheet. The thinking task is organizational: categorization, prioritization, and systematic analysis.
    • **Dynamic complexity:** Occurs due to the interrelationships between variables, like an ecosystem. The thinking task is identifying variables and understanding their influence on each other.
    • We often focus only on detail complexity, but breakthroughs come from understanding dynamic complexity.

14. **Effective problem-solving uses a "right-to-left," top-down approach that begins with the desired outcome.**
    a. The natural (and less effective) approach
    • Thinking flows from left to right, starting at the beginning and working through to the end.
    • It is bottom-up, beginning with familiar details.
    • The outcome is whatever emerges from the analysis, which can lead to "boiling the ocean"—analyzing everything without focus.
    b. The effective approach
    • Thinking is right to left, starting with the desired outcomes and working backward.
    • It is top down, beginning with the core problem and breaking it down.
    • Outcomes are clearly planned from the beginning. The focus shifts from collecting data to developing insight.
    c. The Unity Thought Process
    • This methodology combines the strengths of right-to-left and top-down thinking.
    • It's right-to-left because everything starts with the business outcomes we want to achieve.
    • It's top-down because the real value comes from developing insight, not just organizing data.
    • Top consulting firms like McKinsey begin by asking, "What are you trying to achieve?" not "What data do you have?"

15. **The Situation-Implication-Proposal (SIP) framework provides a simple yet powerful structure for clear thinking and communication.**
    a. The purpose of structured thinking
    • Dr. Hossein Arsham said, "if you cannot describe in writing... what you are doing as a process..., then you do not know what you are doing."
    • SIP forces you to clarify your thinking before you communicate.
    b. The three components of SIP
    • **Situation:** Establishes the context, current state, and relevant facts.
    • **Implication:** Explains why the situation matters by highlighting consequences, risks, or opportunities.
    • **Proposal:** A clear, specific recommendation for action.
    c. SIP as structured storytelling
    • It is the framework that translates your thinking into something others can easily follow.
    • People often struggle with writing because they try to write before their ideas are fully formed.
    • The power of a well-written SIP lies in its logical presentation, airtight thinking, and simple, clear language.
    d. A business case example of SIP
    • **Situation:** Bill production has 90 cycles/month with fluctuating volume (up to 50,000 accounts/day) and varied payment timing (15-29 days).
    • **Implication:** This inconsistency creates uneven workflows, leading to service dips and a 10% increase in staffing costs ($4 million/year). Delayed payments incur an additional $6 million/year in capital costs.
    • **Proposal:** Smooth out bill volumes across the month and enforce a consistent 15-day payment period to stabilize workflows and improve cash flow.

16. **The SIP framework sharpens thinking by forcing a structured progression from analysis to actionable prescription.**
    a. How SIP improves the thinking process
    • Articulating the **Situation** forces you to gather facts and uncover unspoken assumptions.
    • Defining the **Implication** forces you to connect the dots and understand consequences, which is where insight emerges.
    • Crafting the **Proposal** shifts you from diagnosis to prescription, forcing you to consider practical solutions and feasibility.
    b. Mirroring the executive decision-making process
    • Senior leaders naturally ask: "What's the situation?", "So what?", and "Now what?".
    • SIP answers these questions directly in the order executives tend to think through them.
    c. Applications across business functions
    • **Strategic Planning:** Synthesizes market trends to uncover risks and opportunities.
    • **Operational Problem Solving:** Examines process performance to propose targeted improvements.
    • **Investment Decisions:** Frames an opportunity, spells out risks and returns, and culminates in a clear recommendation.

17. **Tailoring presentation content to the audience's knowledge and context is critical for engagement.**
    a. Addressing the audience's knowledge gap
    • A common failure is not considering: "What do they know and what do they not know?"
    • If the group knows little, simplify to the most common denominator and relate the topic to something they do know.
    • If you miss the mark on audience communication style, your credibility is at stake.
    b. Developing an understanding of the audience
    • Ask three main questions: Who are they? How much do they already know? What are their expectations?
    • Build a picture of who they are; some people create personas to refer to while building the presentation.
    • Avoid clichéd or overly broad generalizations that can make your audience feel like a statistic.
    c. Adapting to the presentation environment
    • The larger the audience, the simpler the slides should be. Avoid densely packed slides that function as speaker notes.
    • If presenting to a non-native English speaking audience, simplify your language, avoid idioms, pace yourself, and ensure clear pronunciation.
    • The cornerstone is to do your research early. Talk to the event organizer and engage with attendees beforehand if possible.

18. **A stakeholder matrix is a powerful tool for proactively addressing the diverse interests of a complex audience.**
    a. Mapping stakeholder interests
    • The key to managing multiple stakeholders is preparation.
    • Start by listing each key stakeholder and identifying what they care most about (e.g., strategy, finance, operations).
    • Then, consider the objections or worries they are likely to raise.
    b. An IT system implementation example
    • **CEO:** Cares about strategic impact and ROI. Highlight competitive advantage and long-term gains.
    • **CFO:** Concerned with budget and cash flow. Provide a detailed cost-benefit analysis.
    • **IT Director:** Focuses on integration and support. Present a solid architecture and support plan.
    • **Operations Manager:** Worries about disruption and training. Address with a thoughtful change management plan.
    • **HR:** Cares about the impact on people and morale. Present the communication plan and development opportunities.
    c. The outcome of stakeholder analysis
    • By walking in each stakeholder's shoes, you demonstrate empathy and strategic thinking.
    • When everyone sees their concerns acknowledged and answered, you create the alignment that drives action.





### Key Insights
* The primary goal of a business presentation is to convey information so that others understand it exactly as you do; simple, clear, "journalist-style" language is far more effective than jargon and creative flair.
* The first few pages—the cover, agenda, and executive summary—are the most critical, as they must immediately orient a time-poor executive, state the core message upfront ("answer first"), and provide a clear roadmap.
* Slide titles (or headlines) are the most important element of any page; they must be concise, stand-alone statements that capture the core insight and answer the audience's implicit "so what?" question.
* A "less is more" approach is paramount; presentations should focus on the big-picture insights the client is paying for, not on showcasing every detail of the underlying analysis.

1.  **Effective presentation drafting prioritizes simple, clear language over creative flair to ensure the message is understood.**
    a. The goal of the "Do" phase
    • We are now diving into how to draft your decks in an effective way.
    • The goal is to have error-free documents, which is challenging for smaller firms with fewer resources.
    b. Adopting a journalist's writing style
    • Your presentation doesn't need flair, pageantry, and creative language to get noticed; for management consultants, it's the exact opposite.
    • My recommendation is to use journalist's language, meaning plain but effective words.
    • The ultimate goal is simple: Make the reader read the story, build their perspective, and impact them.
    c. Tools for ensuring clarity
    • One of my favorite tools to check if the language is understandable is the Hemingway app.
    • The tool analyzes text based on criteria like words per sentence, lexical density, hard words, and the fog index (years of education required to understand a text).
    • Steve Jobs's presentation scripts perform really well in the app because his words are simpler and his phrases are less abstract.
    d. The fundamental principle of influence
    • The first question I ask people is: "What are you actually trying to do with the presentation?"
    • After peeling back layers of high-level goals, the simplest answer is: you're trying to convey information effectively.
    • Success in life and business is dictated by your ability to convey your information to others so they understand it the way you do.

2.  **Data shows Steve Jobs's use of simpler language made him a more effective communicator than Bill Gates.**
    a. Sentence length and complexity
    • It's clear from the data that Steve Jobs consistently outperformed Bill Gates in using clear and accessible language.
    • The comparison in table one (Reference to a missing visual table) highlights this.
    • Jobs's sentences were shorter, with an average of 10.5 words in 2007 compared to Gates's 21.6.
    b. Lexical density and vocabulary
    • Jobs's lexical density scores were consistently lower, making his presentations easier to follow.
    • The fog index for Jobs in 2007 was 5.5 compared to 10.7 for Gates, indicating his text was much easier to read.
    c. Connecting with the audience
    • These figures reflect deliberate choices; Jobs opted for conversational language, personal anecdotes, and rhetorical questions.
    • Gates, on the other hand, tended to rely on detailed technical descriptions that could overwhelm his audience.
    • As evident in table two (Reference to a missing visual table), Jobs's quotes are concise and enthusiastic, while Gates's are more descriptive.
    • Jobs's ability to translate complex concepts into simple human language was a key factor in his success.

3.  **The cover page must clearly identify the subject and can be enhanced by applying the SMART framework to its title.**
    a. Basic elements of a cover page
    • **Company Name:** This is a must, displayed clearly in the largest font setting.
    • **Logos and Color Scheme:** Use high-quality logos and the company's marketing color scheme to appear professional.
    • **Title and Date:** State when it was written so the audience can judge its timeliness. The title and date should be in a smaller font than the company name.
    • **Executive Summary:** This can sometimes be on the cover but is normally inside. Keep it simple, clean, and powerful.
    • **Contact Information:** I suggest putting the presenter's name and contact info at the front so the audience knows who is presenting.
    b. Crafting a great title
    • A good title makes the nature of the document clear (e.g., financial analysis, market entry study).
    • A great title tells the audience what you're going to achieve (e.g., "How to get operational excellence in financial services").
    c. Applying the SMART framework to titles
    • McKinsey teaches associates to evaluate objectives using this framework: Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound.
    • An example is "Doubling Serbia's economic growth in the next decade." It is specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant (to Serbian officials), and time-bound.
    • A SMART title for the USPS project could have been "Restoring the USPS to profitability by 2020," which was the ultimate goal of the presentation (Reference to a missing visual case study).

4.  **An agenda page is essential for orienting the audience and typically follows a structured "3+1" format in consulting presentations.**
    a. The "No Agenda, No Meeting" policy
    • I once worked for a firm with this policy, and I still follow it today.
    • The agenda answers the first question in the audience's mind: "What is this presentation about?"
    • When you don't have an agenda, you leave your audience clueless.
    b. The function of an agenda slide
    • It serves as a guidepost for your presentation, like a map in a mall or a floor indicator in a lift.
    • A good practice is to repeat the agenda slide at the start of each new section to show the audience what's covered and what's left.
    c. The McKinsey "3+1" structure
    • Most McKinsey presentations I've seen use a "three plus one" agenda.
    • The first three bullet points encompass the full narrative: 1) Situational Background, 2) The Complication, and 3) The Recommended Strategy.
    • In the USPS agenda slide (Reference to a missing visual case study), these were called "Recent context," "Base case," and "Addressing the challenge."
    • The "+1" is typically labeled "Appendix."
    d. Design and formatting tips
    • The bullets in a McKinsey agenda are extremely short (at most five words) with no sub-bullets. The purpose is to guide, not to inform.
    • One tip is to create the agenda page only when everything else is finalized to avoid rework.
    • Consider using an "intro loop"—a small set of slides that repeat—while the audience is getting seated to prime them with information.

5.  **The executive summary must deliver the core recommendations upfront to respect the executive's time and guide the conversation.**
    a. Starting with the executive summary
    • I always tell junior consultants to start with the executive summary.
    • Remember, the answer comes first. Executives are busy and impatient; sometimes you never get past the first page.
    • Let them know in the first few pages what your recommendations are. This also gives the client control to direct the conversation.
    b. The "Why-How Laddering" framework
    • This is a great framework to write an executive summary.
    • The premise is to ask "why" questions to elevate a need to a higher level and "how" questions to narrow down to specific tactics.
    c. Structuring the summary
    • An example from Accenture consists of two parts. The first is a set of three slides detailing the firm's objective and approach, as shown in slides 4 to 6 (Reference to a missing visual slide).
    • The approach should normally be in the appendix unless the audience needs it for context and confidence.
    • Develop a clear, short overview of your key points in a set of executive summary slides at the front of the deck. Have the rest of your slides serve as an appendix.

6.  **Slide titles are the most critical element and must be concise, informative headlines that answer the "so what?" question.**
    a. The importance of titles
    • I'd argue that titles are the most important part of the slide. If the PowerPoint is New York State, then the title is Manhattan.
    • A good title captures attention, explains why the page is important, and shows how it contributes to the storyline.
    • The challenge is to communicate the main message within two lines in a relatively large font.
    b. Key principles for writing headlines
    • **Keep it short:** People read faster than you speak. Short headlines allow the audience to read quickly and then refocus on what you are saying.
    • **Be informative:** Write in a natural voice. Instead of "Group general investment portfolio," write "Our general investment portfolio grew by 50% per year from 2020 to 2022."
    • **Answer "So What?":** A weak headline like "We have six new clients" fails to answer this. A better version is "Two of them have the potential to bring in more revenue than our best clients do now."
    c. The challenge of brevity and clarity
    • The real challenge is writing what you want to say in the simplest, most compelling way possible. Don't be afraid to rewrite your draft several times.
    • Your audiences are sophisticated and well-educated; they won't be impressed by you showing off your extensive vocabulary.
    • Look at Apple's mission statement as an example of jargon-free, plain, and direct English that makes an impactful statement.

7.  **Adhering to the "less is more" principle ensures the presentation focuses on the big-picture insights.**
    a. Focusing on the corporate strategy level
    • Management consulting focuses on the big picture and what is affecting the entire company.
    • If you find yourself getting into a lot of detail, stop and ask if that level of detail is really needed for the audience.
    • For example, does the CEO of a $50 billion company really want to understand how you calculated a $10 million saving?
    b. Answering the one question that matters most
    • When watching Steve Jobs's presentations, you'll see how good he is at answering "Why should I care?"
    • He connects the dots for his listeners straight away.
    • As a management consultant, we also focus on the key message. The client is paying for insights, not for you to talk through every small detail.

8.  **A comprehensive six-point checklist can be used to validate the quality and effectiveness of all presentation titles.**
    a. Checklist for individual and collective coherence
    • **1. Standing alone, it makes sense:** If your cousin who knows nothing about the topic read the title, would it make sense to them?
    • **2. Together in the presentation, it makes sense:** A partner or client might only read the titles. Make sure they work together to tell a narrative.
    b. Checklist for content and consistency
    • **3. The title matches the page content:** The bullet points, charts, and graphics must support your title.
    • **4. It's consistent:** The presentation should look like one person wrote it. The length, wording, syntax, and tense of titles should be consistent.
    c. Checklist for impact and purpose
    • **5. It's direct and it says something:** Get to the point. Don't hedge. Drive to insights and back them up with data.
    • **6. It has a point of view:** Clients hire you for your ability to distill data down to its essence. Each page needs to say something clearly and answer the question, "So what?"





### Key Insights
* Plain language is a sign of respect for the audience's time and intellect; even experts process simple, clear content faster and more effectively.
* The body of a slide serves a single purpose: to provide direct, credible evidence for the headline. Overloading a slide with content that takes more than three minutes to explain is a common and critical error.
* Maintaining logical rigor is non-negotiable. This involves not only supporting every conclusion with evidence but also actively guarding against common cognitive biases like confirmation bias and confusing correlation with causation.
* Effective visual layout, through techniques like multi-column bullet points and "chunking," can transform a dense slide into a clear and visually engaging piece of communication.

1.  **Deliberate word choice is critical for conveying logical relationships and ensuring clarity in analysis.**
    a. Using words to show contrast and logic
    • At times, using the right word is critical to the flow of the logic.
    • To show contrast without a hard break, you can use the word "despite."
    • For example: "Profits are up despite the fact that revenue was falling over the same period." This forces the client to see the contrast.
    b. A lexicon for presenting analysis
    • **To express percentage of total:** Use "share" or "accounts for X percent."
    • **To rank categories:** Use "ranks larger/smaller than" or "equal to."
    • **To explain trends over time:** Use "trend," "change," "grow," "rise," "decline," or "fluctuate."
    • **To explain frequency/ranges:** Use "X to Y range," "concentration," "distribution," or "occurrence."
    • **To express relationships:** Use "related to," "increase/decrease with," or "correlated to."
    c. The value of neutral language
    • Using joining and descriptive words can help you avoid lengthy content.
    • Bluntness can be an aid but doesn't always work. Stating bluntly "your profits collapsed" is emotive and could cause problems.
    • By keeping language neutral and adding an adjoining word, the client can draw their own conclusions.

2.  **Writing in plain, easily understood language respects the audience's time and increases comprehension.**
    a. The goal of plain language
    • When creating headlines, use plain words to avoid alienating your audience, especially with complex analysis.
    • Plain language means your audience can read, understand, and take action the first time they read your content.
    b. Plain language is not "dumbing down"
    • A professor applied for a £170,000 grant to research "the cognitive measurement of consumer criteria for manufacture of parameter values in biscuit texture."
    • What he meant was he wanted to study "what biscuit texture affects the enjoyment of eating a biscuit."
    • A study found that even users with graduate degrees completed tasks faster when language was simplified, and they had no negative reaction to it.
    • Plain language specialist Ginny Redish said, "it's not a matter of dumbing down, it's a matter of meeting people where they are and saving their time."
    c. Techniques for writing plainly
    • **Put the point up front:** Don't bury bad news; the audience is always looking for the bottom line.
    • **Use the active voice and personal pronouns:** The active voice is more direct and clear. Addressing the audience as "you" is more engaging and human.
    • **Write short, simple sentences:** Challenge every word and get rid of excess. Avoid starting sentences with "It is" or "there is."
    • **Avoid redundancies:** Don't use phrases like "absolutely essential" or "reply back." Just say "essential" and "reply."
    • **Avoid jargon:** Jargon is shorthand for insiders. If you must use it for a non-expert audience, provide an explanation.
    • **Use everyday words:** Instead of "utilize," just use "use." Instead of "approximately," try "about."

3.  **Ellipses can be strategically used in headlines to indicate omissions or create a logical transition between slides.**
    a. Using ellipses to show omission in a quote
    • This is used to leave out a word or words in a quote.
    • For example, a full quote could be shortened: "After acquisition, we need to develop a five step process for running them... and companies using this process are three times likely than others to achieve their desired results."
    b. Using ellipses to show a trailing thought or transition
    • This is used at the end of a sentence to show a break-off or trailing thought.
    • In this example, on page 13 and 14 (Reference to a missing visual case study), the situation transitions to the next challenge, "Loss of postal monopoly..."
    • The use of ellipses at the end of one slide title and the beginning of the next is a technique usually reserved for when the second slide answers a question triggered by the first.
    • In this instance on Slide 14 (Reference to a missing visual case study), it simply indicates an additional independent factor is at play.
    • I think this is a great example of how we use ellipses in consulting presentations to support your logic flow.

4.  **The body of a slide must exclusively contain content that directly supports and adds credibility to the headline.**
    a. The singular purpose of the body
    • Under the headline, the body must feature the most important data to support that headline.
    • Its sole purpose is to reinforce and add credibility, featuring findings from the research period.
    • You can display information using text, charts, visualizations, diagrams, or well-executed bullet points.
    b. A case study example
    • To prove "unprecedented losses" in this slide (Reference to a missing visual slide), McKinsey included a chart with 10 years of financial history plus the expected current year loss.
    • A column of text supplements the chart, addressing key drivers for the loss.
    c. A word of caution on images
    • Be cautious that an image acceptable in one culture may not work in another. Avoid controversial subjects like world leaders or religious organizations.
    • I also try to use timeless content, creating a library you can use again with the client, even years later.
    • I always aim to create a presentation in such a way that if I used it ten years from now, it would still look relevant.

5.  **Professional-quality analysis requires maintaining logical rigor and actively avoiding common cognitive biases.**
    a. The foundation of professional thinking
    • Logical rigor is essential. Every conclusion must be supported by evidence, and every recommendation must logically follow from the analysis.
    • At every step, you should ask if your conclusions are supported, if alternatives have been explored, and if you are addressing root causes.
    • Clients aren't paying for vague opinions or gut feelings; they're paying for thinking that is systematic, logical, and defensible.
    b. Common logical traps to avoid
    • **Confirmation Bias:** Seeking only data that proves your original belief while ignoring challenges to it.
    • **Correlation vs. Causation:** Mistaking two things happening at the same time for one causing the other without a logical link.
    • **Anchoring:** Allowing the first piece of information you see to unduly influence your judgment.
    • **Availability Bias:** Relying on information that's easiest to recall, even if it's not representative.
    • **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Continuing down a flawed path just because you've already invested in it.

6.  **Body content should be structured for clarity, with a rule of thumb being no more than three minutes of delivery time per slide.**
    a. Focusing on value-added insights
    • The bulk of the page should be exhibits that support the headline, such as graphs, tables, or text.
    • There should be a focus on highlighting insights which add value, not simply repackaging client data.
    • Footnotes or appendices can be used for points that need further detail, so someone can refer to your sources when you're not there.
    b. The 3-minute-per-slide rule
    • The body of the presentation (on a single slide) should be covered in three minutes or less.
    • If a slide takes more than three minutes to deliver, you have too much content on it and should consider splitting it into two or more slides.
    • Slide changes create energy by engaging the visual cortex and signaling progress.
    c. Planning meeting duration
    • For a 30-minute meeting, I recommend creating enough slides for 25 minutes of content. For a 60-minute meeting, plan for 50 minutes.
    • The extra time serves as a buffer for latecomers, Q&A, and summarizing actions.
    • Applying the three-minute rule creates at most 8 content-rich slides for a half-hour meeting and 16 for an hour-long meeting.

7.  **Bullet points must be used consistently and concisely to summarize key ideas, not as a substitute for full sentences.**
    a. Key principles for bullet points
    • **A bullet point is not a sentence:** Too many presenters put an entire sentence in a bullet, which defeats its purpose.
    • **Reveal the key idea only:** It should be a short summation, leaving you something to expand upon when you speak.
    • **Use a consistent style:** Always start with a verb or a noun, use the same tense (usually present), and capitalize consistently. I tend to use a verb as it's more action-oriented.
    b. The 6x6 guideline
    • This guideline states that each slide should aim for no more than six bullet points, and each bullet should have no more than six words.
    • Consider this a guideline, not a hard rule. It helps keep slides clean and concise.
    c. Know when not to use bullet points
    • Audiences are increasingly turned off by slides that contain nothing but bullet points.
    • Ensure you also make use of visuals like graphs, diagrams, pictures, and videos to convey key points.
    d. Example analysis
    • In this example, the opening bullet in Accenture's slide (Reference to a missing visual slide) is easier to read than the final bullet because it is shorter and leads with the most important information.
    • While the bullets use parallel construction, as complete sentences they are more suitable for reading, not presenting.

8.  **Effective slide layout, including multi-column designs and "chunking," enhances readability and visual interest.**
    a. Using multi-column layouts
    • I have seen presentations use two columns to display bullet points. It can be very effective and shows the consultants care about conveying the message.
    • We use two- and three-column layouts frequently but don't recommend more than four.
    b. The "chunking" technique
    • For this example, Accenture's slide (Reference to a missing visual slide) converts information that could have been a bland list into columns. This technique is called chunking.
    • In McKinsey's slide (Reference to a missing visual slide), chunking is used with four blocks of text (volume, price, USO, workforce costs) laid out in a grid.
    • Each chunk has its own "so what" summary, and an innermost label summarizes the confluence of all four trends. This is a visually pleasing and effective format.
    c. The importance of consistency
    • You need to keep the look of your slides consistent across images, color schemes, fonts, layout, and logo placement.
    • A great tip is to create one "super slide" and save it as a template to repeat the layout. This helps the audience process content without having to rethink each slide's structure.





### Key Insights
* The primary goal of a chart or graph is to focus the audience's eye on a single, important message; clutter, inconsistent fonts, and a lack of clear emphasis are the most common reasons why data visualizations fail.
* The choice of visualization format is not arbitrary. A simple but powerful framework guides the decision: use graphics for simple relationships and trends, tables for complex relationships or specific numbers, and words for logic and recommendations.
* All charts fundamentally communicate one of five types of comparison: **Component** (parts of a whole), **Item** (ranking), **Time Series** (change over time), **Frequency** (distribution), or **Correlation** (relationships).
* Minimalism is a key design principle for professional charts. Removing unnecessary elements like redundant labels, grid lines, and legends creates white space and allows the core data to stand out, reducing the cognitive load on the audience.

1.  **Effective data visualization avoids common pitfalls like clutter and directs the audience's focus to a single key message.**
    a. Common challenges in presenting graphs
    • Graphs tend to be poorly presented, normally because of space issues and the challenge of fitting everything in.
    • This results in very small font sizes, which can look inconsistent with the style used elsewhere.
    • Ideally, the size of the text in a graph should be the same as on every single slide, a rule used at BCG and other top firms.
    b. Guiding the audience's attention
    • An exhibit should be built so the audience's eye is forced to focus on the most important thing. Arrows are a great device for this.
    • Make sure you don't highlight too many points, as it will make it hard to read and the emphasis will be lost. You want to train the eye once, not twice.
    c. Examples of ineffective charts
    • In this table (Reference to a missing visual slide), the key message is to show strong growth in product B, but the slide shows a whole product line analysis with lots of historical data, blurring the message.
    • This next chart (Reference to a missing visual slide) is a complex diagram that is hard to interpret without expertise. I would either put it in an appendix or unpack it over three separate slides.
    • In another sample chart (Reference to a missing visual slide), the body contains only raw data and no analysis to support the conclusion.
    d. The role of the slide body
    • The body of a slide is crucial because it helps explain and reinforce the message, serving as an aid to memory.
    • On a high level, the slide should never compete with the presenter, because people find it hard to read and listen at the same time.

2.  **Data is the foundation of consulting recommendations because it provides objective, apolitical insights hidden within complex information.**
    a. Data as a source of hidden value
    • Data is where the treasure is buried. Like miners sifting through gravel for gold, consultants sift through terabytes of data looking for insights.
    • The process is laborious, messy, and frustrating, rummaging through a mound of crap to find something of value.
    b. Data as an objective arbiter
    • Data is free of politics and objective. It speaks louder than anecdotes and company folklore.
    • When two departments disagree, it's the only way to cut through the bureaucratic white noise and get people on the same page.
    c. The reality of client data
    • It's an ugly mess. It's rarely organized and is scattered across different software programs, filing cabinets, and employees' heads.
    • It can, however, be beautiful. Data by itself is flat and boring, but it can be transformed from a random set of points into something beautiful.

3.  **Specialized tools like Think-Cell and Tableau can enhance data visualization, but Excel remains a viable option.**
    a. Professional consulting toolsets
    • Consultants at McKinsey use a custom-made version of Think-Cell, a plug-in commonly used by consultants.
    • Firms also have proprietary, macro-based work panels that allow users to create standard forms and shapes with one click.
    • The thing is that Think-Cell only deals with corporate clients and the price tag is quite high.
    b. Recommended alternative tools
    • I'd also recommend Tableau. It's the most user-friendly, powerful, and amazing desktop visualization tool for consultants.
    • Compared with Excel, Tableau is more flexible with drag-and-drop functionality and more unique ways to show data.
    • My consulting firm chose Tableau for its intuitive interface, which reduces the learning curve.
    c. The utility of Excel
    • If you don't want additional subscription costs, you can still use Excel to create charts.
    • It's very easy to store and analyze data from multiple sources, and it works well with almost anybody.

4.  **The choice between a graphic, table, or text depends on the complexity of the relationship being communicated.**
    a. The decision framework
    • We have a simple but powerful framework to help you make a smart choice.
    • **Simple Relationship:** Use a table or a graphic, especially with numerical data.
    • **Complex Relationship:** My recommendation is to use a table because it gives a concise structure to navigate. A mentor of mine always says that tables are underrated.
    • **Something other than a relationship:** Consider using words or a conceptual graphic.
    b. A quick recap of use cases
    • **Use Graphics:** If you want an audience to remember relative trends or picture the flow.
    • **Use Tables:** When you want them to know or be able to refer to specific numbers and the methodology to calculate them.
    • **Use Words:** If you want the audience to understand specific logic, flow, and recommendations.

5.  **All data visualizations fundamentally communicate one of five types of comparison.**
    a. The purpose of charts and graphs
    • I find that charts and graphs are typically used to convey one of five key messages. Choosing a chart depends on what kind of data you have and what you want to express.
    b. Component comparison
    • This shows the size of each part as a percentage of the total.
    • Examples: "In 2020, product C accounted for the largest share of total product sales," or "Client share of market in 2017 was less than 10%."
    c. Item comparison
    • This compares how things rank against each other—if they are the same, more, or less.
    • Examples: "In 2020, the sales of product C exceeded those of product B and G," or "The client's market share ranks fourth in North America."
    d. Time Series comparison
    • This shows how things change over time—whether a trend is increasing, decreasing, or constant.
    • Examples: "Sales have risen steadily since 2020," or "Return on investment has decreased sharply over the last four years."
    e. Frequency Distribution comparison
    • This shows how many items fall into a series of progressive numerical ranges.
    • Examples: "In July, most sales were between $5,000 and $10,000," or "Most shipments are delivered within seven days."
    f. Correlation comparison
    • This shows whether the relationship between two variables follows an expected pattern or not.
    • Examples: "Employee performance in 2020 shows no relationship between stock price and industry confidence index," or "CEO salary doesn't vary with the size of the company."

6.  **Mastery of five basic graph types—Area, Column, Line, Bar, and Pie—is sufficient for most business presentations.**
    a. Area graph
    • This shows the relationship of different parts to a whole over time.
    • Example: Show the breakdown of total organization revenue by product line over the last 20 years.
    • Ideally handles 4 to 6 data series at the same time.
    b. Column graph
    • This shows the differences in individual values vertically.
    • Example: Show the total number of phone calls each month for the past year.
    • Works best with fewer data series, ideally 1 to 3.
    c. Line graph
    • This shows values at different points in time, usually with equal time intervals.
    • Example: Show the trend in customer service calls handled by four offices each month over the last five years.
    • Can display 4 to 6 different data series in a reasonably easy way.
    d. Bar graph
    • This shows the differences in individual values horizontally.
    • I wouldn't suggest using it for showing values in different time periods. It works best for one or two data series.
    • Example: Show the popularity of the top eight answers to a survey question.
    e. Pie chart
    • This shows the proportions of each segment of a whole.
    • This graph only handles one data series.
    • Example: Show the proportion of funding provided to a charity by each of its funding sources.

7.  **Advanced chart types like Waterfall and Gantt serve specialized purposes for visualizing cumulative changes and project timelines.**
    a. Heat Map
    • Data is represented by colors in a two-dimensional format. It provides an immediate visual summary of information.
    • A popular example is the red and blue state maps used during US presidential elections.
    b. Waterfall Chart
    • This helps understand the cumulative effect of sequentially introduced positive or negative values. It's also called a flying bricks chart or a bridge.
    • The chart in this McKinsey slide (Reference to a missing visual slide) is a waterfall chart showing the cumulative effect of volume and price changes on revenue.
    • I prefer positive and negative changes to be shown in different colors for easy interpretation.
    • The way Accenture used the waterfall on the right side of the slide (Reference to a missing visual slide) is incorrect; it should be a standard bar chart.
    c. Gantt Chart
    • Invented in 1910, it's a critical tool for planning projects, explaining them to others, and monitoring schedules.
    • It has dates across the top, a task list down the side, and bars showing how long each task will take.
    d. Radar Chart
    • This displays multivariate data on three or more axes starting from the same point, giving it a star-like appearance.
    • It can be used to answer questions like: Which observations are most similar? Are there any outliers?
    e. Bubble Chart
    • This chart displays three dimensions of data. Two values are expressed by the bubble's X/Y location, and the third is expressed by its size.
    • It can be considered a variation of the scatter plot.

8.  **Every component of a graph must be intentionally designed for clarity, minimalism, and low cognitive load on the audience.**
    a. Key graphical elements
    • **Colors:** Ensure enough contrast between the background and data series. Maintain consistency with your company's branding.
    • **Depth:** I'd heavily suggest going with 2D graphs over 3D.
    • **Axes:** Label axes clearly with values big enough to be read. An unclear axis can lead to misunderstanding.
    • **Data Labels:** Use a text box with the actual data value placed close to the data point. Ensure the text is readable and has enough contrast.
    • **Graph Title:** Graph titles should merely explain the function of the graph (e.g., "Y versus X"). The slide's main "so what" title is separate.
    • **Legends:** Research has shown that a legend distracts the audience. It's better to add text labels directly on the chart to indicate each data series.
    b. The principle of minimalism
    • You should remove all unnecessary elements from graphs to keep your charts simple.
    • Compare the net profit loss chart McKinsey actually designed to the one in this slide (Reference to a missing visual slide). The actual version is more professional because it removes unnecessary elements.
    • McKinsey removed the Y-axis label (explained in title), vertical grid lines (values are labeled), X-axis tick marks, and the legend (only one data series).
    • This creates white space for information-rich annotations.

9.  **The final chart selection can be guided by determining if the goal is descriptive (showing what is) or explanatory (showing why it is).**
    a. Descriptive Graphics
    • **Column/Line Chart:** Use for time series. Use a column chart for fewer than six time points; use a line chart for more than six data points or for continuous data.
    • **Bar/Stacked Column Chart:** Use for comparisons of items or parts of a whole, such as survey responses, cost structures, or market share.
    • **Mapping Techniques:** Use territory maps for market attractiveness or process maps for efficiency measures.
    b. Explanatory Graphics
    • **XY Scatter Chart:** Use for point regressions to show causal relationships.
    • **Bubble Chart:** Use for regressions where a third dimension is required.





### Key Insights
* When visualizing data, perceptual accuracy is paramount; for this reason, pie charts should generally be avoided in favor of horizontal bar charts, which allow the human eye to compare lengths on a common baseline far more easily than it can compare 2D areas.
* The type of comparison you need to make dictates the chart you should use: use bar charts for item rankings, column/line charts for time series, histograms for frequency distribution, and scatter/bubble charts for correlation.
* Three-dimensional charts should be avoided entirely. The distortion caused by the 3D depth-of-field effect makes it difficult for an audience to accurately perceive and compare data values, undermining the chart's primary purpose.
* Creating an effective chart is a systematic process that begins with a clear, single message. This message guides the choice of data, the type of chart, and all design decisions, ensuring the final visualization is persuasive and easy to understand.

1.  **For component comparison, pie charts should generally be avoided in favor of more perceptually accurate horizontal bar charts.**
    a. The common problems with pie charts
    •   Pie charts are widely used, but many consultants recommend avoiding them as research shows it's difficult to compare sections accurately.
    •   **Meaningless Color:** Excel automatically assigns many colors that create optical illusions, where darker slices appear larger than lighter ones of the same size.
    •   **Perceptual Difficulty:** Our eyes are not great at attributing quantitative value to 2D spaces. It's hard to tell which segment is bigger when they are close in size.
    •   **Data Label Clutter:** Adding data labels to clarify sizes takes up a lot of space, especially with smaller slices.
    b. The recommended alternative: Bar charts
    •   I'd normally suggest replacing pie charts with a horizontal bar chart, organizing the data from greatest to least.
    •   Our eyes can easily and quickly assess the relative size of bars because they share a common baseline, making it clear not only which is largest but by how much.
    c. Rules for using pie charts if necessary
    •   In the firm I used to work for, we only used pie charts to compare no more than six components. We'd use an "others" category to reduce the number of slices.
    •   Position the most important component against the 12:00 line or rank components by decreasing size clockwise.
    •   Strategically use color to highlight only the one or two slices you want to draw attention to.
    •   When the unit is a percentage, the actual total value is often provided like this (Reference to a missing visual example) to give a general impression of the total number.
    •   You can also slice out the part you want to emphasize like this (Reference to a missing visual example), but my recommendation is to have no more than five slices.
    d. Alternatives and poor combinations
    •   Treemaps are an elegant alternative that mitigates the perception problem by sizing rectangular tiles in proportion to their data values. This BCG slide is a nice application (Reference to a missing visual slide).
    •   A poor combination is comparing components across two different pie charts instead of using a stacked column chart. In this example (Reference to a missing visual slide), we can clearly see it's impossible to establish sensible comparisons between two pie charts.

2.  **Bar charts are the most effective tool for item comparison, with several variations available to show more complex relationships.**
    a. The function of a bar chart
    •   Management consultants usually use bar charts for item comparison because they are the most simple and effective way to compare quantitative values.
    •   One axis shows the specific categories being compared, and the other represents a measured value.
    •   A bar chart presented vertically becomes a column chart.
    b. Best practices for bar charts
    •   In this example (Reference to a missing visual slide), we use percentages to measure and rank competitors, and we round the figures for clarity.
    •   Use color to emphasize your target. In this example (Reference to a missing visual slide), we highlight our client in Gray.
    •   When a value is too big for the chart, breaks like this (Reference to a missing visual example) are used.
    •   Do not extend bar charts to zero, as not starting from a zero baseline can confuse readers or lead them to different conclusions.
    c. Six variations of bar charts
    •   **Deviation Bar Chart:** Distinguishes profit winners from losers.
    •   **Sliding Bar Chart:** Shows the different mix of two components (e.g., imports vs. exports).
    •   **Range Bar Chart:** Shows the spread between low and high amounts (e.g., a range of discounts).
    •   **Paired Bar Chart:** Shows the correlation between two items (e.g., market growth vs. market share).
    •   **Grouped Bar Chart:** Compares various aspects of the same item.
    •   **Subdivided (Stacked) Bar Chart:** Shows components that make up a total. In this example (Reference to a missing visual slide), we use it to show the proposition of profit sharing in each industry.

3.  **Time series data is best represented by column charts for small data sets and line charts for larger or continuous trends.**
    a. Using column charts for time series
    •   A column chart uses horizontal bars with proportional lengths to compare data.
    •   It is only feasible for small sets of data points. If it's a large set, I'd use a line chart.
    •   In this example (Reference to a missing visual slide), we are using a column chart to show a sales trend over the last seven years.
    •   Variations include deviation, range, grouped, subdivided, and step column charts.
    b. Using line charts for time series
    •   A line chart is used to visualize the value of something over time and is preferable for a larger set of data.
    •   The horizontal x-axis is the independent axis (e.g., time), and the vertical y-axis is the dependent axis (e.g., revenue).
    •   More than one line can be plotted for comparison, with each line having a different color identified in a legend.
    c. Best practices for line charts
    •   Leave off symbols unless they provide critical information.
    •   If you have multiple time series, differentiate lines with color variation first and line style second.
    •   Avoid using too many lines in one chart, as it creates readability issues. If you have many things to compare, draw multiple charts.
    d. Interpreting trends with line charts
    •   Line charts bring order to chaos by revealing patterns and trends.
    •   You can draw trend lines to define an uptrend or downtrend, and parallel lines to form a channel that can predict short-term changes.
    •   Line charts also reveal areas of congestion called triangles (ascending, descending, symmetrical), which can forecast price targets.

4.  **Frequency distribution is visualized using histograms or column charts to show how many items fall into specific numerical ranges.**
    a. Function of frequency distributions
    •   These are visual displays that organize frequency counts so information can be interpreted more easily.
    •   The y-axis (vertical) represents the frequency count, and the x-axis (horizontal) represents the variable being measured.
    b. Examples of frequency charts
    •   In this one (Reference to a missing visual slide), the x-axis is frequency of shipment and the y-axis is the number of orders. We can easily see the majority of shipments are received in 5 to 6 days.
    •   A histogram is used to summarize discrete or continuous data. In this example (Reference to a missing visual slide), it divides the range of sales values into classes, showing most sales are between $30 and $50.
    •   In this example (Reference to a missing visual slide), we use line charts for competitor data and columns for our data to show that the age distribution of our customers differs sharply from that of our competitor.

5.  **Scatter and bubble charts are used to illustrate correlation, but it is critical to remember that correlation does not imply causation.**
    a. Using scatter charts for correlation
    •   In my opinion, a scatter graph is the most effective way to visualize two-dimensional sets of data.
    •   It uses horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) value axes to plot data points and show how one variable affects another.
    •   In this example (Reference to a missing visual slide), a chart shows the correlation between discount and sales volume.
    b. The importance of causation vs. correlation
    •   In this BCG presentation (Reference to a missing visual slide), they show the interrelationship between mail volume growth and household penetration.
    •   The chart title honestly refers to correlation ("is a function of"), not causation.
    •   That's worth repeating: Correlation does not mean causation. Any cause and effect must be validated through other means. Acceptable language includes "as a function of," "points to," or "is related to."
    c. Using bubble charts for a third dimension
    •   A bubble chart is a variation of a scatter chart where data points are replaced with bubbles.
    •   An additional dimension of the data is represented in the size of the bubbles. It plots X values, Y values, and Z (size) values.

6.  **While generally discouraged, a secondary Y-axis can be used cautiously by following specific design rules to minimize confusion.**
    a. The problem with a secondary Y-axis
    •   It's an area of dispute among data visualizers. The viewer needs to spend mental energy figuring out which axis describes which data series.
    •   In the leftmost graph in Accenture's slide (Reference to a missing visual slide), the point is to show a decline in mail volume. The firm had other options, like showing only one data series or splitting the chart in two.
    b. Four tips for using a dual Y-axis chart
    •   **1. Use the left Y-axis for the primary variable:** Our brains are conditioned to look left first.
    •   **2. Color-code your axes and data:** This helps the user visually identify which axis corresponds to which data plot.
    •   **3. Synchronize Y-axis scales:** When plotting the same variable in different units (e.g., Centigrade and Fahrenheit), it's best to synchronize the two axes.
    •   **4. Avoid using the same chart type for both data sets:** Using a column chart and a line chart can prevent the data from interfering with each other visually.

7.  **Three-dimensional charts should be avoided because the depth-of-field effect distorts perception and makes accurate data comparison difficult.**
    a. The fundamental flaw of 3D charts
    •   I'm not a fan of 3D charts. What makes them unique is their biggest problem: the depth of field effect creates confusion for your audience.
    •   Adding a third dimension is just giving them more work to do, which goes against our goal of making the message easy to get.
    b. How 3D charts distort data
    •   In the simple 3D clustered column chart below (Reference to a missing visual example), our brains make false readings based on the background grid.
    •   The tallest blue column visually aligns with the grid line for 50, but its actual value is 65.
    •   Comparing columns is extremely tough because they all start at different points. The tallest blue and green columns appear to be the same height, but they are not.
    c. Additional problems
    •   Adding data labels to a multi-series 3D chart makes it overly busy.
    •   A higher value column in the foreground may totally obscure a lower value column in the background, resulting in missing data.
    •   Identifying patterns and trends in a 3D chart is a lot more difficult than in a 2D chart.

8.  **A final checklist of design principles serves as a foundation for all effective charts.**
    a. Core framework for chart design
    •   **1. Don't add unnecessary complexity:** Keep it simple. The biggest error with data visualization is clutter.
    •   **2. Check the data:** If you're using weak data, your graph will be weak. Verify everything that doesn't make sense.
    •   **3. Explain encodings:** Whether using a color scale or bubble size, explain what they indicate in a legend or with direct labels.
    •   **4. Label axes:** The audience needs to know the scale and what the data is about. Always start your axis at zero.
    •   **5. Include units:** Eliminate guesswork for the audience by noting whether you mean percentages, volume, etc.
    •   **6. Include your sources:** This makes your graphic more reputable and allows interested audience members to dig deeper.
    •   **7. Don't use any more colors than needed:** McKinsey only used black and white for a really long time.
    •   **8. Consider your audience:** Remember who they are and what they want to get out of the chart.

9.  **Creating a successful chart is a systematic five-step process that begins with a clear message and ends with a refined, tested visualization.**
    a. Step 1: Start with your message
    •   Before touching any data, be crystal clear about the one key insight you want the audience to understand and the action you want them to take.
    b. Step 2: Identify the data relationship
    •   Identify what type of relationship best supports your message (e.g., ranking, time series, composition).
    c. Step 3: Choose the chart type
    •   Based on the data relationship, choose the chart type that will most effectively communicate your message (e.g., bar chart for ranking, line chart for time series).
    d. Step 4: Design for clarity and impact
    •   Apply design principles to make your chart clear and persuasive. Choose colors that support your message, add clear labels, and remove unnecessary elements.
    e. Step 5: Test and refine
    •   Show your chart to someone who wasn't involved in creating it. If they cannot immediately understand the message, refine your design until it is unmistakable.





### Key Insights
* Effective executive communication must be purpose-driven and audience-centric, leading with an insightful recommendation rather than the topic, and respecting the intense competition for executive attention.
* The "Rule of Three" is a powerful structuring principle that applies at all levels: every slide should make one main point supported by no more than three pieces of evidence, and the overall presentation should follow a three-act structure (Situation, Complication, Resolution).
* The MAC method (Madman, Architect, Carpenter, Judge) provides a systematic four-stage process for building presentations, ensuring that broad exploration is followed by structured storytelling, rapid content creation, and disciplined editing.
* Tables should be used only when the audience needs to know precise numerical values; otherwise, a graph is superior for showing trends. When used, tables must be designed for simplicity and readability, with data arranged to highlight patterns.

1.  **Tables must be strategically designed for clarity, used only when exact values are necessary, and words should be used sparingly.**
    a.  Best practices for designing tables
    •   What's on screen should help tell the story of the data, not just present it for the audience to figure out.
    •   Arrange numerical data in columns rather than rows, as it's easier for people to detect patterns reading down.
    •   Arrange data according to magnitude if possible to show numerical progression. If columns have conflicting orders of magnitude, structure the table around the most important column or split the table.
    •   Present numbers in their simplest format by rounding values and stating units (e.g., write "3.4 million" instead of "3,400,000 USD").
    •   Avoid a spreadsheet look; do not bound each entry in a box. Use formatting like bold headings, shading, and thin lines selectively to enhance readability.
    •   Prioritize information from top to bottom and left to right for Western cultures, ensuring the table proves the slide's core message.
    b.  When to use tables
    •   Management consultants rely on tables when the audience needs exact values, which are nearly impossible to determine with precision from a graph.
    •   Tables allow for the simultaneous showing of detailed data and summary statistics. In BCG's table (Reference to a missing visual slide), it showed mail numbers (detail) and change percentages (summary).
    •   Tables are the only option when you need to mix text data and images, as illustrated in Accenture's slide (Reference to a missing visual slide).
    c.  Comparing tables and charts
    •   Tables interact with our verbal system, allowing for sequential processing and side-by-side comparison of data.
    •   Charts rely on our visual system to perceive shapes and forms, making it easier to extract patterns and relationships from large quantities of data.
    •   A single chart can often convey important features more vividly and memorably than columns of data.
    d.  Using words on slides
    •   Words should be used sparingly because the audience can either listen to you or read your slides, but not both at the same time.
    •   Slides with too much text like this (Reference to a missing visual example) cause cognitive overload.
    •   As management consultants, we limit word slides to these uses: leading the audience through a logic flow (summarizing findings/recommendations) or presenting qualitative information.

2.  **Effective executive communication is purpose-driven, audience-centric, and structured by the Rule of Three.**
    a.  Competing for executive attention
    •   You're not just sharing information; you're competing for the most precious resource in business. A typical Fortune 500 CEO receives over 120 emails and attends 6-8 meetings daily.
    •   Your presentation competes with merger discussions and crisis management. Every word must earn its place.
    b.  Defining a crystal clear purpose
    •   Before writing a single word, you must answer: "What specific action do I want my audience to take after reading this?"
    •   The vast majority of consulting decks suffer from "purpose drift," losing focus in an attempt to showcase analytical prowess.
    •   A weak purpose is "consider a multi-phased approach." A strong purpose is "convince the CEO to approve a $2.3 million investment...that will increase customer retention by 15%."
    c.  Deep audience understanding
    •   You're presenting to people under intense pressure. The CEO is worried about earnings, the CFO about cash flow, and Operations about efficiency. Your presentation must speak to these specific concerns.
    •   Frame recommendations to connect to their pressures. Instead of "implementing RPA to improve efficiency," say "To protect margins against rising labor costs...we recommend investing $15 million in automation that will reduce unit costs by 23%."
    d.  The Rule of Three
    •   Organize your thoughts into three clear, logical components (e.g., Problem, Pressure, Opportunity).
    •   Every slide should make one main point, supported by no more than three key pieces of evidence. If you have 4-5 bullet points, you're trying to say too much.
    •   The overall presentation should follow a three-act structure: Act 1 (Situation/Current State), Act 2 (Complication/Challenge), and Act 3 (Resolution/Recommendation). This mirrors how executives think.

3.  **The four-stage MAC method (Madman, Architect, Carpenter, Judge) provides a systematic process for building presentations.**
    a.  Overview of the MAC method
    •   Great consulting presentations are built systematically, not in a single burst of inspiration.
    •   The method has four stages: Madman, Architect, Carpenter, Judge. The real value comes from not skipping or blending them.
    b.  Stage 1: Madman (Exploration)
    •   Collect every relevant data point, insight, and idea without editing or filtering. Think of it as intellectual free play.
    •   Your job is to gather broadly and think freely. Organization comes later.
    •   A key discipline is source tracking; your credibility depends on it.
    c.  Stage 2: Architect (Structuring)
    •   Distill your research into a coherent story that moves the audience from problem to solution.
    •   Start with the Rule of Three to identify the biggest themes.
    •   Don't just present facts; tell a story and always ask "so what?" to connect insights to client goals.
    •   Plan the flow of your presentation based on how your audience makes decisions.
    d.  Stage 3: Carpenter (Building)
    •   Speed is key. Follow your outline and focus on laying down content fast. Don't get hung up on perfect sentences.
    •   Start with slide titles, which should be full-sentence insights, not vague headings (e.g., "Customers are shifting to digital channels 3x faster..." instead of "Customer Analysis").
    •   Fill in content with bullet points (max three per slide).
    e.  Stage 4: Judge (Editing)
    •   Edit with discipline. Every word must earn its place. Cut fluff, strengthen verbs, remove jargon.
    •   Check that every slide flows logically to the next. If you need to verbally explain a transition, the structure needs work.
    •   Review for consistency in terms, formatting, and numbers.
    •   Apply the elevator test: Can you summarize the entire presentation persuasively in two minutes?

4.  **Powerful consulting writing is characterized by ruthless simplicity, direct language, and a confident, professional tone.**
    a.  Practicing ruthless simplicity
    •   Complexity is the enemy of action. The more complex your analysis, the simpler your presentation needs to be.
    •   I reviewed a presentation where the CEO said, "I don't have time for this. Give me the bottom line in 30 seconds."
    •   Distill complex analysis into clear, actionable insights. Instead of a long paragraph, say "We can cut costs by 15% by improving operations."
    •   Keep your average sentence length to no more than 15 words.
    b.  Avoiding the jargon trap
    •   Jargon undermines your goals of sounding professional and helpful. It signals lazy thinking.
    •   A team recommended their client "leverage synergistic opportunities to optimize value creation..." They meant "cut costs and improve quality to beat competitors."
    •   Instead of "leverage," say "use." Instead of "synergies," be specific about the combined benefits.
    •   Present recommendations first, then the supporting logic. This respects the executive's time.
    c.  Mastering tone
    •   You want to sound confident, but not arrogant; knowledgeable, but not condescending.
    •   Avoid "hedge language" (potentially, possibly, might). It makes you sound unsure. Instead of "might help improve retention," say "will increase retention by 15%."
    •   Avoid "consultant speak" (passive voice, abstract language). Use active voice ("We recommend...") and specific numbers.
    •   Use "we" to refer to your team's work and "you" to refer to your client's actions to create a personal connection.

5.  **Communicating effectively in global business requires focusing on clarity and cultural context over a single "standard" English.**
    a.  The importance of writing quality
    •   Research from Harvard Business Review shows executives spend an average of just 30 seconds scanning a document before deciding whether to read it.
    •   A Grammarly analysis found that professionals who made fewer writing mistakes were promoted more quickly and earned higher salaries.
    b.  Standard vs. variant English
    •   There's no single universally accepted standard for business English. What's standard in London might differ from New York or Singapore.
    •   What matters isn't conforming to one standard, but being clear, professional, and appropriate for your audience. Clarity is more important than complexity.
    •   Non-native speakers often excel at explaining complex ideas clearly because they've learned English as a system.
    c.  Challenges in global business English
    •   **Cultural Context:** The same phrase can have opposite meanings. "Let's table this discussion" means postpone in the US but discuss now in the UK.
    •   **Communication Style:** Some cultures value directness (Germany), while others prefer subtlety (Japan).
    •   **Idioms and Jargon:** Phrases like "slam dunk" or "circle back" can be confusing.
    d.  Defining your company's business English
    •   Every company should define its own version of business English based on its culture, industry norms, and audience.
    •   A practical starting point is to audit your current best-performing communications to see what tone and style work best.

6.  **High-quality presentations are built on reliable data from diverse sources and are polished with transitional kickers.**
    a.  Reliable data sources for consulting
    •   **Previous Projects:** This becomes a competitive advantage.
    •   **Ready-made Reports:** From sites like Statista, Trend Economy, and EMIS.
    •   **Raw Data Sources:** Euromonitor, Bloomberg, reports of publicly traded companies (especially IPO prospectuses).
    •   **Expert Interviews:** Finding experts within the firm or through networks.
    •   **Field Research:** Store checks or mystery shopping to gather data not officially available.
    •   **Estimation by Proxy:** Using an observable, connected market to estimate an unobservable one.
    •   **Existing Online Data:** Facebook Audience Insights, Google Keyword Planner, Similarweb, Google Trends.
    •   **Previously Recreated Resources:** Reports on SlideShare, interviews on YouTube.
    b.  The role of the kicker
    •   A kicker is used to add clarification, summarization, or the implications of the information on a slide. It's often referred to as the "So what?"
    •   A good test for a slide is whether you can come up with a compelling "so-what" for it. If not, consider moving it to the appendix.
    •   By having a kicker on the slide, you're providing an answer to the "so-what" question. I strongly recommend it as a punchy one-liner.
    c.  Key functions of a kicker (Source: Kicker Checklist image provided by user)
    •   Keeps the story going.
    •   Summarizes the slide, reiterates the main point, or draws out implications.
    •   Can be written or oral.





### Key Insights
* The appendix is a critical tool for maintaining the simplicity and narrative flow of the main presentation; it should house all necessary supporting data that, while important for Q&A, would otherwise clutter the core story.
* To avoid "boiling the ocean," consultants must ruthlessly prioritize which analyses to include in a presentation, focusing on insights that are both important and urgent and sequencing them in a way that aligns with the audience's natural decision-making process.
* Systematic version control, using either file naming conventions for simple documents or version control tables for complex ones, is essential for managing the multiple iterations of a presentation in a team environment.
* Legal disclaimers are a necessary component of external consulting presentations to protect intellectual property through confidentiality notices and to limit liability by framing the content as information rather than advice.

1.  **Effective presentations for change management require systematic version control to manage document iterations.**
    a.  The importance of version control
    •   Good presentations are events along the journey of change and can't be recycled.
    •   Since it's all about change, version control is very important. It is the management of multiple versions of the same document.
    b.  File naming conventions
    •   At a simple level, use the file name to identify the version and status alongside the subject (e.g., `Corporate_strategy_Draft_V0.1`).
    •   You must update the version number on the file name and inside the document's header.
    •   Save updated versions as read-only to force the creation of a new version upon the next update.
    c.  Version numbering for minor and major revisions
    •   **Minor Revisions:** Small changes like spelling or grammar corrections can be noted by increments to the decimal number (e.g., V1.1, V1.2).
    •   **Major Revisions:** Revisions that require the document to be re-approved can be reflected by incrementing the whole number (e.g., V1.0 to V2.0).
    d.  Version control and document control tables
    •   Use these to provide historical data about each update.
    •   It's useful to include the author, date, and notes about each change made so you can refer back to what was changed.
    e.  Best practices for version management
    •   **Document Owner:** When multiple parties are involved, one individual should be nominated to manage the overall version control.
    •   **Keep Draft Versions:** A decision must be made whether to keep or delete drafts once a final version is agreed upon. A good reason to keep them is to preserve a record of the development process.
    •   **File Storage:** In my firm, we never copy client presentations to a public cloud like Dropbox or iCloud. We use encrypted email, a portable disk, or a hard copy to pass presentations to clients.

2.  **The appendix is a critical tool for keeping the main presentation simple and story-focused while retaining supporting data.**
    a.  The purpose of the appendix
    •   The goal is to keep your main slides simple and easy to understand. The temptation is to pack slides full of data, but this is not needed.
    •   The appendix is where you put supporting materials that don't fit in the main narrative but are valid and useful to your case.
    •   By keeping this data in the appendix, you avoid overloading your main slides and overwhelming your audience.
    b.  Content for the appendix
    •   It can take the form of all types of things, whether that be raw data, testimonials, detailed process maps, or additional charts.
    •   Essentially, it's anything which could be useful to back up what you're saying in the main body.
    c.  Using the appendix during the presentation
    •   Having the appendix gives you a backup source which you can turn to as and when needed during the Q&A or conversation with the client.
    •   The key point is that it's there as a backup so you can focus your main slides on the story and the big picture.

3.  **Legal disclaimers are an essential component of professional presentations to protect intellectual property and limit liability.**
    a.  The function of a disclaimer
    •   Disclaimers protect both the presenter and the event host from legal liabilities arising from the presentation's content.
    •   In consulting firms, a legal team helps work out the formal disclaimer; we just need to remember where, when, and how to insert it.
    b.  Protecting intellectual property
    •   Persuasive business presentations often contain material nonpublic information.
    •   It's a good idea to include a notice of confidentiality and non-disclosure, as Accenture has done in this slide (Reference to a missing visual slide).
    •   Always consult an attorney for language, as some jurisdictions may require specific language in the footer of every slide.
    c.  Copyright and fair use considerations
    •   You need to be very careful about reproducing material you find. Attribution, though always required, may be insufficient.
    •   I am able to reproduce the Accenture presentation because I obtained permission and because my intent is for critical and educational purposes, protecting me under the fair use provision of US copyright law.
    d.  Limiting legal liability
    •   The title "About This Document" in this slide (Reference to a missing visual slide) protects Accenture by framing the presentation as "information" rather than "advice."
    •   I find this sort of hedge disingenuous, but if it provides legal protection in certain jurisdictions, I cannot recommend otherwise.
    •   Such language is typically not required for presentations developed and delivered internally.

4.  **Prioritizing analysis for the final presentation is crucial to avoid "boiling the ocean" and focus on the most impactful insights.**
    a.  The challenge of selecting analysis
    •   On a typical project, you conduct extensive analysis for multiple hypotheses, but you won't include all of it in the presentation.
    •   Once you do the analysis, you must consider which parts need to be shown and in what order to enhance the storyline.
    •   A consultant can analyze almost every aspect of an organization, but the majority of that analysis makes little impact on the objective. Don't boil the ocean.
    b.  A framework for prioritization
    •   **1. Collect a list of all your analyses:** Bring together everything that could possibly be in the presentation.
    •   **2. Look at what's urgent vs. important:**
        •   If it's a crucial analysis for a decision that needs immediate attention, list it in the key findings section.
        •   If it's important but not urgent, consider where it fits in the storyline.
        •   If it's neither important nor urgent, take it out of the storyline and put it in the appendix or remove it completely.
    •   **3. Assess the value:** Consider the order of the slides. Recognize which tasks have top priority over others.
    c.  An example of prioritization in practice
    •   In McKinsey's USPS presentation (Reference to a missing visual case study), there were two sets of recommendations: standard actions and fundamental change actions.
    •   A key principle in storytelling is that characters (and organizations) always take the minimum conservative action first. They pursue fundamental change only when standard actions fail.
    •   Due to this risk aversion, McKinsey started with "standard actions" within USPS control, as shown in this slide (Reference to a missing visual slide).
    •   This slide (Reference to a missing visual slide) provides the bottom-line impact of reducing losses through standard actions.
    •   That triggers the question of what those actions are, which this one (Reference to a missing visual slide) provides the answer to, with four groups of standard actions.
    •   Slides 24 to 26 (Reference to a missing visual slide) detail the key actions to achieve these savings. I think this is a great example of how we prioritize analysis and present findings based on financial impact.





### Key Insights
* The design of a presentation is not decorative; it is a critical part of the communication. Big firms invest heavily in design because a seamless, professional aesthetic builds credibility and aids comprehension.
* A clear visual hierarchy is paramount. This applies to fonts (a large headline, a medium subheading, a smaller body), colors (a primary palette with one or two accent colors), and layout (consistent positioning and ample whitespace).
* Simplicity and subtlety are key principles. Backgrounds should be simple (ideally solid white), transitions should be minimal, and images should only be used if they constructively add to the story, not as decoration.
* Every design choice, from font size to color to table formatting, must prioritize the audience's ease of understanding. If a design element makes the audience work harder to interpret the message, it has failed.

1.  **Presentation themes provide a consistent design framework that should be customized to suit your specific purpose.**
    a.  The strategic importance of design
    •   In a big firm, you are usually backed by a digital design team. McKinsey even bought a top design firm a couple of years ago.
    •   This shows a trend: big companies pay for design expertise because the consumer experience has to be seamless.
    •   We need to know the ground rules of design, just in case you're working in a boutique firm or a startup.
    b.  Using and customizing themes
    •   Themes give you a consistent approach for your presentation. If you plan on designing them frequently, you should create your own.
    •   All applications ship with default themes. In this one here in Microsoft PowerPoint (Reference to a missing visual example), you can see there's a wide range.
    •   When you pick a theme, I recommend you filter through the pre-made content, such as deeply nested bulleted lists, and remove what you don't need.
    •   Basically, use the framework that exists, change it to suit your own purposes, and then you have something you can repurpose quickly.

2.  **Color palettes should be chosen strategically based on industry associations and corporate branding, using online tools for assistance.**
    a.  The psychology and context of color
    •   Personally, I look for associations that particular industries or cultures have with certain colors.
    •   This presentation has a predominantly blue look because blue is considered a positive color globally. In Western cultures, one association with blue is business, trust, and security.
    •   I'm also using the association of a blueprint, which is linked with construction design.
    b.  Working with corporate style guides
    •   Not everyone has the luxury of choosing their own colors. You may have to adhere rigidly to a corporate style guide.
    •   This may mean your only latitude is to use tints and shades for variation, but always check with your branding department first.
    c.  Creating your own color theme
    •   First, pick a base color, then find 2 to 4 colors that go well with it.
    •   Ideally, you'll need some hue/tonal variations on the base color and 1 or 2 accent colors to be used sparingly to draw attention.
    d.  Helpful tools for color selection
    •   There are a number of websites that can help you.
    •   **color.adobe.com:** You can enter a base color and it generates a whole bunch of different themes for you.
    •   **coolors.co:** This is effortless. You can just tap the space bar and have themes generated for you.

3.  **A clear typographic hierarchy, limited font choices, and legible font sizes are essential for guiding the audience's attention.**
    a.  Establishing a type hierarchy
    •   Choose a suitable typeface for your headline, which should be the largest and most present text on your slide.
    •   Subheadings should be slightly inferior to the headline; I tend to make mine optically around 55-65% of the headline size.
    •   My body text is generally optically around 35-45% of the headline size.
    •   A type hierarchy ensures the audience doesn't have to question if they're seeing a title, subheading, or caption.
    b.  Guidelines for font usage
    •   Use an absolute maximum of three fonts. If you can, use one font with several different weights (heavy, medium, light).
    •   Limit the amount of text on your slides and always prefer images over text if you can.
    •   Validate your font size. As Guy Kawasaki famously said, a good rule of thumb is to divide the oldest investor's age by two.
    •   Consider font compatibility. If a computer can't read your unique font, it will swap in another one, making your careful selection redundant.
    •   Use whitespace. Nancy Duarte calls this "breathing room," and it's something consultants are uniquely bad at. Look at this one slide from Deloitte that I dug up here (Reference to a missing visual example); it is a perfect example of what not to do.
    c.  Specific font recommendations for consulting
    •   My personal advice is to use exactly two standard fonts: one for slide titles and one for body text.
    •   **Slide Titles:** Use a large, bold, high-contrast sans-serif font (e.g., Arial, Helvetica). Titles may span up to two lines. In most cases, this means title text of at least 36 point.
    •   **Body Text:** Should be in a more readable serif font (e.g., Times New Roman, Georgia). In most cases, this means body text of at least 24 point.

4.  **Professional presentations adhere to strict formatting standards for text, color, layout, and tables to ensure clarity and consistency.**
    a.  Text and color standards
    •   All text should be black by default for maximum contrast and readability. Bold formatting should be used strategically.
    •   Color should be reserved for data visualization elements. When used, it should serve a specific purpose, like matching text to chart elements.
    •   McKinsey presentations typically use a four-color system for data visualization (primary, secondary, tertiary, and additional categories).
    •   Your color choices must work for audience members with different types of color vision and remain clear when printed in black and white.
    b.  Layout and spacing
    •   Every slide should follow a consistent layout template with standardized margins, spacing, and element positioning.
    •   The goal is to create a visual rhythm that guides your audience through the content logically.
    c.  Table formatting requirements
    •   Numbers should be right-aligned with each other but left-aligned with column headers.
    •   Individual boxes should be used for each number to ensure proper alignment.
    •   All rows and columns should be aligned both horizontally and vertically. Totals must be double-checked.
    d.  Legends and stickers
    •   Legends should follow McKinsey format standards with clear, descriptive labels.
    •   Stickers should be positioned above legends and clearly indicate the status or qualification of the content.

5.  **Images must be used to constructively advance the story, require careful attention to licensing, and should never be decorative clipart.**
    a.  The role of images
    •   Images are the first elements on a slide your audience will notice, so it is your duty to ensure they contribute constructively to the storytelling. If not, leave them off.
    •   The modern version of randomly placing ClipArt is randomly copying and pasting images from the Internet to literally or metaphorically represent a concept.
    •   As much as I appreciate McKinsey's storytelling, this slide (Reference to a missing visual example) exemplifies the merely decorative use of images.
    b.  Image formats
    •   **JPEG:** Typically used for photographic content.
    •   **PNG:** Used for both graphics and photos, especially where transparency is required.
    •   **GIF:** Typically used for graphics; an animated variant is available. I've never used any GIFs in my whole career.
    c.  Best practices for working with images
    •   Don't forget you can crop your image to suit your purpose. You can see how the cropping is down (Reference to a missing visual example), making it a much more suitable image.
    •   Don't steal images off the Internet. Wikimedia Commons has a large collection, but check the license before you use any files.
    •   Never use copyrighted images unless you've bought a license. Don't simply go to Google thinking nobody can track it. Remember, consulting firms are all about being ethical.
    •   Don't use any nasty old clipart. Nothing screams "amateur" more than using clipart like this one on the screen (Reference to a missing visual example).

6.  **Video should be used sparingly and technically prepared to ensure it aids audience understanding without causing disruption.**
    a.  Three rules for using video
    •   **Third:** Only include video if it helps the audience to understand. I know I've said that a lot, but it's the primary thing to consider.
    •   **Second:** Set the video to autoplay on the slide to prevent that awkward "moving to the play button" moment.
    •   **First:** If you get a chance, run the video on your machine before the presentation. This helps with frame caching and prevents problems.
    b.  Personal use cases
    •   Personally, I use video quite a lot, but mainly in looping intros built for audiences as attendees take their seats.

7.  **Slide backgrounds must be simple and subtle to support the main content, with solid white being the safest and most effective choice.**
    a.  Principles for effective backgrounds
    •   Backgrounds should be subtle and simple. You definitely don't want other elements competing with the background.
    •   Solid colors work well for just about everything. Image backgrounds should be avoided except in very special circumstances.
    •   Accenture's slide (Reference to a missing visual slide) has a solid background. Any pattern or image, no matter how subtle, draws the reader's eye away from the text.
    b.  Common mistakes with backgrounds
    •   I'm going to fault BCG this time for embedding its company logo in a massive font into the background of every slide (Reference to a missing visual slide). It seems like an inappropriate design choice conveying hubris.
    •   In contrast, Accenture placed a diminutive version of its logo in the slide footer, which is a best practice. The bottom right and left are the subtlest locations.
    c.  Types of backgrounds
    •   My best advice is to use white as a background color.
    •   Textured backgrounds should be dialed back, perhaps by overlaying them with a semi-transparent colored block.
    •   Gradient fills can really put a spotlight on your content, but be careful of soft colors that might get washed out on a projector.

8.  **Transitions and animations should be used minimally in a consulting context, primarily for the progressive reveal of content.**
    a.  Defining transitions and animations
    •   Transitions are the effects that go between slides.
    •   Animations refer to things that are on slides.
    •   Effects like Morph in PowerPoint are a hybrid of both.
    b.  Use in management consulting
    •   As management consultants, we really try to limit the number of animations because our target audience is C-level executives. They don't like too many moving objects.
    •   The primary use is to "build," which reveals slide content progressively, either on click or after a time delay.
    •   I think animation and transition work really well if you're broadcasting dense content to students, using features like text fade or reveal to grab more attention.





### Key Insights
* The most effective consulting presentations are not data dumps but are structured narratives that guide the audience from insight to action. This is achieved through frameworks like "Setup, Conflict, Resolution" for storytelling and the six standard elements of a McKinsey slide.
* Every slide must communicate exactly one clear message, a principle that forces the presenter to do the hard analytical work of identifying the single most important insight from their data.
* A slide's message title is its most critical component; it must be an interpretive, full-sentence insight (e.g., "Sales have doubled") rather than a descriptive label (e.g., "Sales Data").
* An effective presentation must conclude with an actionable implementation plan structured at three levels: strategic (big picture resources), tactical (workstreams and milestones), and operational (detailed next steps).

1.  **The flow of information in a presentation must be strictly controlled to ensure the audience can assimilate key messages.**
    a.  The presenter's role in pacing
    •   If you glance at a complex graph like the one below for only two seconds, you probably won't get a lot of information (Reference to a missing visual example).
    •   In a presentation, it is the presenter who controls the pace, not the audience.
    b.  Three characteristics of impactful presentations
    •   **1. The amount of information is limited:** This is crucial for avoiding cognitive overload.
    •   **2. The pace of information is strictly controlled:** Using builds and clicks ensures the audience focuses on the right information at the right time.
    •   **3. It's laid out to assist assimilation:** The structure helps the audience understand.
    c.  An example of controlled information flow
    •   In the next sequence, the images appear as the patter is delivered next to each build (Reference to a missing visual example).
    •   **Click 1:** "What I'm about to show you is sales revenue for the last 18 months. The scales here show $0 to $1 million."
    •   **Click 2:** "Look at the revenue projection before we factored in the influence of project X."
    •   **Click 3:** "Now look at our actual sales revenue figures with the project."
    •   **Click 4:** "The impact of Project X was therefore this area here."
    •   **Click 5:** "I therefore submit that Project X has cost the business far more than it was worth."

2.  **Data-driven insights should be presented within a narrative structure of Setup, Conflict, and Resolution to be persuasive.**
    a.  The narrative framework
    •   Instead of presenting disconnected analyses, weave your findings into a coherent story that builds toward your recommendations.
    b.  The three acts of data storytelling
    •   **Setup:** Establish the business context and why the analysis matters.
    •   **Conflict:** Present the key challenges or opportunities revealed by your data.
    •   **Resolution:** Show how your recommendations address these challenges.
    c.  A cost reduction project example
    •   **Setup:** Rising input costs and competitive pressure are squeezing margins across the industry.
    •   **Conflict:** Our analysis reveals that your cost structure is 15% higher than best-in-class competitors, primarily due to procurement inefficiencies.
    •   **Resolution:** A focused cost reduction program targeting these areas can restore your competitive cost position and improve margins by 300 basis points within 18 months.

3.  **Effective implementation plans must be specific, measurable, and structured hierarchically at strategic, tactical, and operational levels.**
    a.  The characteristics of a strong implementation plan
    •   They are specific, measurable, time-bound, and assign clear ownership. Most importantly, they connect each action to a business outcome.
    •   **Weak:** "Improve customer service capabilities to enhance satisfaction." This is too vague to be actionable.
    •   **Strong:** "Launch a 90-day customer service improvement program led by the VP of Operations, focusing on three initiatives: reduce call wait time to under 2 minutes..."
    b.  The strategic level of implementation
    •   This addresses the big-picture questions of resource allocation, organizational changes, and timeline priorities.
    •   Example: "Allocate $15 million over 18 months to digital transformation, with 60% focused on customer-facing technologies..."
    c.  The tactical level of implementation
    •   This breaks down strategic initiatives into specific workstreams and milestones, providing a project management framework.
    •   Example: "Execute digital transformation through four parallel workstreams: customer portal development (months 1-12), mobile app launch (month 6-15)..."
    d.  The operational level of implementation
    •   This provides the detailed next steps that can be implemented immediately.
    •   Example: "Week one: establish project management office... Week two: conduct vendor selection process... Week three: begin requirements gathering..."
    e.  Structuring for different stakeholders
    •   The CEO wants resource requirements, the project manager needs task lists, and employees need to know how their work will change.
    •   Structure recommendations hierarchically, starting with an executive summary and drilling down to a detailed action plan, so each stakeholder can find the level of detail they need.

4.  **The McKinsey Standard Elements framework provides six key components for creating a single, clear message on every slide.**
    a.  The importance of a consistent structure
    •   This isn't by accident; it's the result of decades of refinement in how to communicate complex business insights clearly and persuasively.
    b.  Element 1: The Message Title
    •   This is the interpretation of your data, not just a heading. It does the analytical work for the executive.
    •   Instead of "Sales data for Q3," it should be "Sales of Froglets have doubled in the last five years."
    c.  Element 2: The Exhibit Title
    •   This describes the content of your visualization and serves as a bridge between the key message and the data.
    •   Example: "Sales of Froglets (millions), 2001-2005."
    d.  Element 3: The Sticker
    •   A small box that provides qualification of the content, such as "Preliminary," "Confidential," or "Draft."
    •   This manages expectations, provides legal protection, and demonstrates professional transparency.
    e.  Element 4: The Legend
    •   It defines shadings, colors, and symbols. Colors and patterns should be chosen strategically to support the story (e.g., green for outperforming markets, red for underperforming).
    f.  Element 5: The Source
    •   This attribution at the bottom of the slide is crucial for credibility.
    •   Sources are typically cited as "Source: Company interviews, McKinsey analysis" or "Source: Industry reports, team analysis."
    g.  Element 6: Footnotes
    •   These provide space for essential context, definitions, or caveats that are necessary for complete understanding, such as methodological notes or data limitations.

5.  **Great data visualizations are guided by four fundamental principles: one clear message, format consistency, readability, and the "less is more" philosophy.**
    a.  Principle 1: One Clear Message Per Exhibit
    •   Every slide should communicate exactly one clear message. Avoid cramming multiple charts or competing headlines onto a single slide.
    •   A slide titled "Q3 Viewer Analysis" with four charts forces the executive to do the work. Instead, create four separate slides with clear messages like "Weekend viewers binge watch 40% more content..."
    b.  Principle 2: Simplicity and Consistency in Format
    •   Use the same visual elements for the same meanings throughout your presentation.
    •   Maintain consistent sizing and positioning. This allows the audience to quickly compare across time periods without wasting mental energy figuring out new formats.
    c.  Principle 3: Readability
    •   Ensure your message and content conform to create maximum clarity. This includes readable fonts, a clear visual hierarchy, and color choices that work for everyone.
    •   Every element should be designed to accelerate understanding, not showcase analytical sophistication.
    d.  Principle 4: Less is Always More
    •   This is the most challenging principle as it requires discipline to decide what *not* to include.
    •   Attention is a finite resource; every additional element on your slide competes for it.
    •   Be strategic about what belongs in the main presentation versus what should be available in appendices.





### Key Insights
* The practical side of a presentation, including room setup and equipment checks, demands as much foresight as the content itself; arriving early to test everything is a non-negotiable golden rule.
* Practice is the key to mastering delivery. Following the principle of the "10,000-hour rule," consultants should rehearse formally and informally to internalize the flow, practice the Q&A, and get feedback from their team.
* Strategic pre-meeting communication, typically a short email, is a critical tool for setting the stage, ensuring audience alignment, showing respect for executives' time, and making the eventual meeting more efficient and productive.
* A final, rigorous slide review is essential. Each slide must be checked against a detailed list of questions to confirm its contribution to the story, its connection to audience needs, and its overall clarity and consistency.

1.  **A final slide review must be conducted from the audience's perspective using a comprehensive checklist to ensure clarity and impact.**
    a.  Adopting the audience's perspective
    •   Remember it's all about your audience, not you. The audience may be more interested in the findings than the substance, so you need to focus on that.
    •   Organize findings by insights, use colorful editing, deploy the active voice, and ensure the body of each slide supports the headline.
    •   Get feedback from your team and invite others to comment on what you're doing.
    b.  A final review checklist
    •   **How does this slide contribute to the story?**
    •   **How does it help the audience address their needs?**
    •   **Does management want or need to know what's on this slide?** Everything on the slide?
    •   **Is the point of this slide clear? Is it clearly laid out in the title?**
    •   **Is the title closely connected to the body of the slide?**
    •   **Is the body of the slide easy to read? Is it parallel? Does it contain any unneeded material?**
    •   **Does your story follow a logical and interesting storyline?**
    •   **Is the conclusion always supported by data and analysis?**
    •   **Is data always stated with a source?**
    •   **Are you using consistent format and color schemes?**
    •   **Are there any typos?**
    c.  The goal of the review
    •   If you have all positive answers from these questions, I'm sure your presentation is all set and ready.
    •   It's not enough to just have good slides; you need to make sure you have a good way of presenting them.

2.  **The presentation room must be carefully selected and set up to match the audience size and desired level of interaction.**
    a.  Preliminary checks with the facilitator
    •   Although it's not always our job to book a room at a client's site, it's always reassuring to double-check if it's ready.
    •   Confirm the room size. A room that is too small can cause delays and panic, while a room that is too big can cause echoes.
    •   Check the equipment, including the projector, Wi-Fi, and screen.
    b.  Theatre style layout
    •   This setup allows for the most people in a given room size.
    •   It works well if the audience is mainly listening and interaction is minimal.
    c.  Classroom style layout
    •   This requires about three times as much space per person as it provides a surface for papers and equipment.
    •   It works well for audiences that need to take notes or work individually.
    d.  Cabaret style layout
    •   People sit in groups around tables; this is better suited for workshops.
    •   To put emphasis on the presentation, arrange seats in a U-shape around each table so no one has their back to the presenter.
    e.  Boardroom style layout
    •   This is the most commonly used style for a management consultant.
    •   It works well if the group is reasonably small and will spend most of the time in discussion.
    f.  Horseshoe style layout
    •   This is similar to boardroom style but allows more people to participate and gives most a better view of the projector screen.
    •   Walking into the "hole" in the middle is a good way for the speaker to command attention.
    g.  Open space layout
    •   This is the best format for truly interactive meetings where everyone is in a single conversation.
    •   A downside is the lack of a surface for note-taking, but it encourages collaboration. It requires a strong facilitator to prevent chaos.
    h.  The three golden rules for the room
    •   **1. Arrive early** so you can tackle any problems.
    •   **2. Ensure the room is tidy** to create a positive impression and reduce distractions.
    •   **3. Test all the equipment** to make sure it works.

3.  **Mastery in delivering presentations is a skill achieved through dedicated practice, including informal rehearsals and formal dry runs.**
    a.  The 10,000-hour rule
    •   Malcolm Gladwell describes the 10,000-hour rule as the time it takes to master a skill.
    •   Delivering presentations is a skill you can master if you practice and prepare with passion and attention to detail.
    b.  Practice techniques
    •   **Practice formally and informally:** Ask a colleague for feedback, tell your family about the topic over dinner, or leave the opening on your own voicemail.
    •   **Do a dry run:** It's best to do this in the same room where you'll be delivering the actual presentation.
    •   **Time yourself:** Ask someone to time you or even audio/video tape yourself to see yourself in action.
    •   **Practice the Q&A:** Ask colleagues to shout out questions that might come to mind.
    •   **Include visuals:** Know what slides are coming up ahead and be sure to practice with those visuals behind you.
    c.  The value of rehearsal
    •   Even Steve Jobs, a master showman, needed a lot of time to practice. A retail executive recalls waiting for hours for Jobs to come off the stage from a rehearsal.
    d.  Final advice on preparation
    •   Reach out to your manager and get feedback.
    •   Stress-test your ideas with your network in an "idea fight club."
    •   Don't suffer in silence; use the power of your teams.

4.  **Pre-meeting emails are a simple but powerful tool for setting expectations, ensuring alignment, and showing respect for the client's time.**
    a.  The purpose of a pre-meeting email
    •   The most effective meetings are almost always prepared, framed, and guided in advance.
    •   It's a short, professional message you send to the client or key stakeholder before the meeting.
    b.  Setting the stage
    •   It tells your client what to expect, what you'll be discussing, and often includes materials for review.
    •   This gives them time to prepare questions, so when you walk in, you can get straight into a real conversation instead of wasting 20 minutes on introductions.
    c.  Showing respect
    •   You're showing your client that their time matters and that you've done the work in advance.
    •   Senior executives who are often in back-to-back meetings appreciate having a chance to get up to speed beforehand.
    d.  Ensuring alignment
    •   A pre-meeting note ensures there are no surprises. A client can flag an unexpected agenda point before the meeting instead of reacting negatively in front of the group.
    •   A pro tip is to keep it short: 2 or 3 sentences explaining what's attached and why is enough.

5.  **Effective pre-meeting communication requires doing homework on the audience, leveraging champions, and clearly stating the meeting's purpose and required actions.**
    a.  Answering the key executive questions
    •   The key questions on an executive's mind are: "Why am I here?" and "What do you need me to do?"
    •   The success of your presentation relies on the quality of your setup communication.
    b.  Doing your homework
    •   Gather essential information from their administrative staff: How far ahead do they plan? When will a reminder email get the most attention? Do they prefer to read on their phone or computer?
    c.  Picking your champions
    •   If you have someone who knows your audience and can give you their stamp of approval, you're not going in cold.
    •   This may be as minor as the legal counsel saying, "I hear that John is bringing you his latest analysis... You'll be impressed."
    d.  Sharing the hook
    •   Your pre-meeting communication needs to include the headline of the message, a brief preview of your content, and why it's relevant.
    e.  Setting expectations
    •   Your email should answer the question: "What do you need me in this meeting for?"
    •   State if you expect a discussion, a decision, their blessing, or approval for further action.
    f.  Building rapport on the day
    •   If you can't book a pre-meeting, still go early.
    •   Take time to introduce yourself to people in the group and ask about their expectations or interest in the topic. This builds rapport and shows you care about their individual concerns.





======================================================================================================================================





### Key Insights
* A presenter's credibility is their brand and is conveyed through every aspect of their delivery, including their introduction, body language, vocal tone, and even their attire. It is built before, during, and after the presentation.
* Effective delivery is a performance that requires mastery of the material, which enables confident body language, purposeful pauses instead of filler words, and the ability to engage the audience rather than reading from slides.
* The presenter must control the environment by preparing for everything from room layout and microphone use to handling interruptions and tough questions in the Q&A, which should be viewed as an opportunity to shine, not a risk to be feared.
* A presentation does not end when the speaking stops; it must conclude with a strong call to action, be followed by prompt meeting minutes within 24 hours, and trigger a self-assessment process for the presenter to identify areas for improvement.

1.  **The presentation opening must immediately establish a positive connection with the audience and build the speaker's credibility.**
    a.  Crafting the opening
    •   Thank the person who introduced you to quickly establish a link with the audience.
    •   Express sincere enthusiasm for the topic and tell the listeners why you're glad to be there.
    •   A simple but effective opening can define the purpose and preview the main points, such as: "It's a pleasure to get together with such a large group of amazing talents to work out the plan to help us enter the Asian retail market."
    •   You can also use a hook, like asking for a show of hands in response to a provocative question that sets up your topic.
    b.  Establishing credibility through perceptions
    •   Credibility is the brand that represents you as the speaker.
    •   If you're an outsider, it helps if someone from inside the organization introduces you. If not, connect with audience members before you start.
    •   Your goal is to manage the perception of an outsider by having relevant information.
    c.  Establishing credibility through actions
    •   Talk with authority on topics where the research is ample, recent, and relevant.
    •   Starting a sentence with "From what I read in your company's annual report..." shows interest and builds credibility.
    •   Avoid hedges like "kind of" or "I feel." Replace them with strong words like "I know" or "In my research I found that..."
    d.  The importance of respect
    •   Your audience is taking time from their busy schedules, so don't waste it. Treat them with kindness and hold them in high regard.
    •   Introduce yourself and learn participants' names. Calling them by name is professional and builds trust.
    •   For face-to-face classes, I create a seating chart and spell names phonetically (Reference to a missing visual example).

2.  **A speaker's physical presence—encompassing attitude, body language, and vocal delivery—is critical for conveying confidence and authenticity.**
    a.  The four essential qualities
    •   There are four top qualities we've told every junior consultant at my firm: confidence, enthusiasm, authenticity, and being natural.
    •   The key is confidence. People won't see how nervous you are, so don't tell them. Smile and look confident even if you don't feel it.
    •   Enthusiasm will make your speech come alive and capture attention.
    •   Being authentic is crucial. There's only one secret to a great presentation: believe in yourself and be yourself.
    •   If you don't know your key messages and storyline, your confidence is useless. The root of an extraordinary presentation is always your expertise.
    b.  Eliminating filler words and weak language
    •   Many presenters unconsciously use words like "uh," "um," or "ah." In a presentation, silence is not a cue for others to speak; it's a powerful tool to emphasize a point.
    •   Phrases like "possibly" and "perhaps" can dilute the strength of your message and reduce confidence in your words.
    c.  Body language and eye contact
    •   Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 93% of a message's meaning is carried by nonverbals.
    •   Use open body language (avoid crossing your arms) and purposeful movement to convey openness and honesty.
    •   "Power poses," where you stretch out your chest or use your hands frequently, can help you dominate more of the room.
    •   Eye contact is a sign of sincerity and keeps you in tune with how clients are feeling. It is essential to building connection and trust.
    d.  Learning from masters like Steve Jobs
    •   If you watch his iconic presentations (Reference to a missing video), you'll notice three techniques.
    •   **Eye Contact:** He maintains eye contact nearly all the time because he has rehearsed enough to not need his slides as a crutch.
    •   **Open Posture:** He rarely crosses his arms or hides behind a lectern, ensuring there are no barriers between him and his audience.
    •   **Hand Gestures:** He punctuates nearly every sentence with a gesture that reinforces his words, making him relatable and dynamic.
    e.  Vocal delivery
    •   A great voice can stir feelings and focus attention. The tone of our voice is not one which many consultants will spend time focusing on, despite its importance.
    •   The key to controlling your voice is controlling your breathing and the tightening of your vocal cords.
    •   To improve your voice, relax. Take a few deep breaths, consciously relax your shoulders, throat, and jaw, and focus on your purpose of helping the client.

3.  **Commanding the presentation space requires deliberate posture, strategic movement, and proficient use of equipment like microphones.**
    a.  Using a microphone
    •   If an event coordinator offers you a microphone, use it. Test it first.
    •   The main reason presenters become microphone shy is a fear of the unfamiliar sound of their own amplified voice. A sound check makes the speaker comfortable.
    •   If using a lavalier mic, know that you may need to hook it up in private. Dresses and lavalier mics don't tend to mix well, as the battery pack needs a firm belt line.
    b.  Owning your space with posture
    •   Look like you've been there before. If sitting, pick the middle of the table, not the head.
    •   Stand tall with your shoulders relaxed and square towards the audience so you can be "heart to heart" with them.
    •   To avoid swaying, plant your feet in a V. If sitting, ground your feet on the floor.
    c.  Using movement strategically
    •   Professional speakers often refer to the "Speaker's Triangle," a movement space that allows them to walk and plant while making important points.
    •   If you have a strong closing point, consider taking a step or two forward for effect.
    •   Practice with the projector on so you don't nervously end up in front of the light. Consider blanking your slides to make a point that relies only on your words.

4.  **Effective delivery relies on using minimal notes, adhering to the 10-minute rule for audience attention, and never reading directly from slides.**
    a.  The mistake of reading slides
    •   Reading slides is a novice mistake. They are there to give structure to the narrative, not to be read verbatim.
    •   Reasons not to read slides include: people read faster than you talk, it's insulting to the audience, your back will be to them, and it feels like reading from a script.
    •   The worst presentation I ever saw was a presenter reading a 15-page script that was identical to the 50-page slide book he handed out.
    b.  Using notes effectively
    •   Never read from a script or learn it by heart. If your mind goes blank, you're stuffed.
    •   I think an A4 page of notes is good. You can leave it on the table and glance at it; the audience probably won't even notice.
    •   I don't like little cards; the writing is small, you have to keep turning them, and the audience can see them.
    •   The best way of all is to be cued by your visual aid. If you find you can't remember a key number, put it on the slide.
    c.  The 10-minute rule
    •   Your audience checks out after ten minutes. The brain gets bored.
    •   Molecular biologist John Medina's peer-reviewed studies confirm the ten-minute rule.
    •   Steve Jobs never gave the brain time to get bored; his presentations included demonstrations, other speakers, and video clips. Obey the ten-minute rule and give your listeners' brains a break.

5.  **Professional presenters must skillfully manage live interactions, including interruptions, mistakes, and the Q&A session.**
    a.  Handling interruptions
    •   If it's a minor issue (a phone ringing), just smile and instantly dive back into what you're doing.
    •   If the interruption is big (a power loss), make a note of where you are, wait for the group to adjust, then take 20-30 seconds to summarize what you've covered before continuing.
    b.  Handling mistakes
    •   If you know you've made a tiny mistake (mispronouncing a word), don't say anything, just keep going.
    •   In case of a bigger mistake, casually own it and then move on. For example, "Wait a minute, I misspoke. The cost is $50,000, not $30,000. Okay, now when we go to market..." I didn't apologize; you don't need to.
    •   If someone else points out your mistake, just be grateful, thank them, correct yourself, and keep going.
    c.  Using humor
    •   Humor can be a powerful icebreaker, but it's a double-edged sword. If it doesn't come naturally, it's best not to force it.
    •   Self-deprecating humor is often a safer choice. Sarcasm or jokes at someone's expense can backfire.
    d.  Taking notes during a presentation
    •   A framework we developed at McKinsey is called Sky-Rain-Umbrella. We separate an A4 paper into three sections.
    •   **Sky (left):** Write down the facts we collected from observation or client feedback.
    •   **Rain (right):** Use analytical skills to explain possible reasons or results.
    •   **Umbrella (top):** Conclude the action plan. We decide to take an umbrella because the sky is dark (fact) and it's going to rain (analysis).

6.  **A presenter's personal appearance and dress are critical first impressions that contribute to their overall credibility.**
    a.  First impressions
    •   Mark Twain is said to have commented that clothes make a man. Our clothing is one of the first things people see.
    b.  Key factors to focus on
    •   What you wear will depend on the industry, geography, and audience, but you can focus on cleanliness, being well-arranged, and your audience.
    c.  Cleanliness and being well-arranged
    •   Wrinkled or dirty clothes are associated with a lack of attention to detail.
    •   "Well-arranged" refers to your overall appearance. Your hair should be neat and orderly, and clothes should be pressed and ironed.
    d.  Dressing for your audience
    •   Which clothes are required for the situation trumps your personal style.
    •   If your industry is casual but the person you're meeting with likes to be formal, aim to be the same as them.

7.  **The presentation must conclude with a strong call to action, followed by prompt meeting minutes and a thorough self-assessment.**
    a.  Structuring the opening and closing
    •   Beginnings and endings should be the bookends of your information. Always connect the dots from the opening back to the close.
    •   If you opened with a story, refer back to it. If you asked a question, provide an answer.
    b.  The call to action
    •   Contrary to popular belief, asking "Do you have any questions?" is not the best way to end a presentation. End with a call to action.
    •   A strong call to action reiterates the challenge and your solution, recommends specific actions, and obtains commitment.
    •   Remind your audience of the benefits and make it a logical conclusion. The audience should be able to mentally connect their actions with a positive outcome.
    c.  Handling the Q&A session
    •   The Q&A is your time to shine. The fear of unknown questions is unfounded, as the presenter controls how to respond.
    •   Create eye contact, don't interrupt the questioner, and repeat the question to confirm understanding and give yourself time to think.
    •   For tough questions, anticipate them beforehand, be gracious and not defensive, and be honest when you don't know the answer.
    •   Don't end abruptly after the Q&A. Wrap up the discussion with a brief summary to reinforce your message.
    d.  Sending meeting minutes
    •   We've got to send out the meeting presentation and minutes within 24 hours after the meeting.
    •   Use a consistent format, include discussion recaps, be specific on major decisions, list complete names of attendees, and present action steps and deadlines clearly.
    e.  Post-presentation self-assessment
    •   The act of delivering a presentation will often expose flaws. Make a list of those flaws as soon as possible, no more than an hour or two after.
    •   Think of specific fixes for next time and write them down.
    •   Ask colleagues for frank feedback on both the content and the delivery of your presentation.

8.  **Presentation length is a function of credibility; strong firms can be concise because trust is already established.**
    a.  Credibility over complexity
    •   The length of a presentation is dictated not by the complexity of the subject, but by the credibility of the firm and the audience.
    •   Adding more slides doesn't automatically create trust. Either you walk into the room with credibility or you don't.
    b.  The signal of long reports
    •   Overly long reports can signal weak credibility. Weaker firms often pad their decks with slides in the hope it will make them look authoritative. It doesn't.
    c.  Mastery builds credibility
    •   I genuinely love consulting, so I know my material inside out. I can often walk through a report without looking at it.
    •   The first time I did this, the reaction was surprise and respect. It showed mastery, confidence, and the ability to extract the big picture.
    d.  The reality of executive meetings
    •   A 60-minute slot might only give you 30 minutes with the key decision-maker. Your presentation needs to be crisp, clear, and adaptable.
    •   Credibility is built long before the final meeting. The three factors that matter most are the reputation you've built, the clarity of your report, and you as a person. The report is the least important of the three.

### Key Insights
* The core philosophy of a world-class consulting presentation is that headlines alone must tell a complete, logical story, and each slide must function as a standalone document that communicates its point without explanation.
* The ultimate purpose of a consulting presentation is not to inform, but to persuade and drive change within an organization; the deck is the primary tool for changing minds and behaviors.
* A partner-level review of any presentation starts by reading only the headlines; if the story is not compelling and coherent at this level, the underlying content is irrelevant and the deck is considered broken.
* Modern tools like custom ChatGPT prompts can serve as a "secret weapon," providing consultants with instant, partner-level feedback on slide structure, logic, and clarity, thereby accelerating the refinement process.

1.  **The core philosophy of consulting presentations is that headlines must tell a complete story and each slide must function as a standalone document.**
    a.  The foundation of great slides
    •   I've said it many times: great slides have to be clean, simple, minimal in color, and laser-focused in message. They should deliver impact without clutter.
    •   You could read textbooks like The Pyramid Principle, but they're fine, and honestly, most of them are overengineered.
    b.  The primacy of headlines
    •   Consulting lives and breathes in the headline. When partners review decks, they don't dive into the content; they skim the headlines.
    •   If the logic doesn't hold up in the headlines alone, the deck is broken.
    •   No data dumps, no vague two-word placeholders. Say exactly what you mean and say something that matters. Be insightful.
    c.  The "Standalone Slide" golden rule
    •   There's one golden rule I live by: If you have to explain your slide before someone gets it, your slide is wrong.
    •   Your deck should speak for itself. You should be able to hand your slide over, leave the room, and still have someone walk away with the key insights.
    •   When consultants present and say, "Let me explain what I was trying to do here," I stop them immediately. If it's not clear from the deck, it's not ready.

2.  **A partner-level review process prioritizes storyline logic in headlines before scrutinizing the supporting body content for clarity and professionalism.**
    a.  The headline-first review method
    •   If a junior consultant hands me a presentation, I cover up the content and read only the headlines.
    •   If the storyline doesn't make sense at that level, then we don't move forward. Only when the headlines land do we go into the supporting analysis.
    b.  Writing precise and powerful headlines
    •   Your headline needs to be precise and strong. No corporate fluff.
    •   Don't say, "The scope of this study is to evaluate x, y, z." Instead, say, "We're recommending four immediate actions to reduce costs by 12%."
    c.  Maintaining professionalism and clarity
    •   Make sure the language you use is clear across cultures and time. Avoid outdated idioms or slang. A good slide should still look sharp ten years from now.
    •   Avoid flashy photos, copyrighted images, or anything controversial. Keep things neutral, timeless, and professional. Don't use Google Images; respect ethics.
    d.  Structuring the slide body
    •   The body should serve one purpose: support the headline.
    •   If you're going to include a chart, make it simple, clear, and consistent. All fonts should be the same size.
    •   Train your audience's eye. If green means Ontario Power Generation, it should always mean that.
    e.  Using kickers effectively
    •   Not every firm uses them, but I love them. A kicker is a punchy one-liner at the bottom of the slide that says "so what?"
    •   It drives the point home or sets up the next slide. Use it only when you have something insightful to add.

3.  **The ultimate purpose of a consulting presentation is not to inform but to persuade, drive change, and achieve alignment with key stakeholders.**
    a.  The goal: persuasion over information
    •   Great presentations don't just inform, they persuade.
    •   In strategy consulting, your job isn't just to deliver findings. It's to change minds, change behavior, change organizations. Your deck is your tool.
    b.  Planning with intention
    •   You've got to plan your presentation with intention. Who's in the room? What do they need to hear? What's standing in the way of action?
    c.  The importance of pre-meetings
    •   That's why we do pre-reads and pre-presents. When you finally show the full deck, it shouldn't be the first time your audience hears the key ideas.
    •   The goal is no surprises, just alignment.
    d.  The Plan-Do-Review cycle
    •   After the meeting, you review what worked and what didn't. Did we hit the goal? What feedback did we get? Plan. Do. Review. Always.
    e.  A practical storyboarding trick
    •   When I storyboard, I draw out a full nine-frame matrix (three rows, three columns) and write only the headlines.
    •   Then I read them out loud. Does the story build? Does it flow? If not, I go back and revise.

4.  **A custom ChatGPT prompt can be used as a powerful tool to get partner-level feedback on slide structure, logic, and clarity.**
    a.  The secret weapon for slide improvement
    •   I've taken all of these principles and distilled them into a single, ready-to-use ChatGPT prompt.
    b.  How to use the prompt
    •   First, go to the next lecture and copy the prompt template (Reference to missing course content). Customize it to match your project's context.
    •   Open ChatGPT, paste the prompt, and upload the PowerPoint file you want to review.
    •   ChatGPT will analyze each slide, identifying headline issues, structure problems, layout flaws, and more.
    c.  Taking the analysis further
    •   You can ask ChatGPT for side-by-side comparisons, headline rewrites, layout adjustments, or cleaner formatting ideas.
    •   It's like having a partner-level coach sitting next to you, giving real-time, personalized feedback.

5.  **Mastering presentations is a cornerstone of a successful consulting career, offering the opportunity to build trust and influence major business decisions.**
    a.  The significance of consulting presentations
    •   It is probably the most significant element of a consultant's career.
    •   You will discuss major business problems with C-level executives, boards of directors, or even the president of a country.
    •   This is the opportunity to create a connection with your client and transform it into a major business decision.
    b.  The foundation of connection and trust
    •   People buy into help and advice from those they trust, and they trust people they like.
    •   Your consulting presentation offers the opportunity to make this connection.
    c.  Final advice for delivery
    •   Be enthusiastic; it's contagious. Focus on your body language and natural vocal delivery.
    •   These things might appear to be common sense, but a majority of business people today don't give them a second thought.
    d.  Concluding message
    •   I want you to be conscious and intentional when you're thinking about this area.
    •   When you work on these areas, your storyline will be more compelling, and more importantly, your clients will feel more confident with your advice and act upon it.
    •   I'd like to thank you for taking the time to join this course and I look forward to hearing about your excellent career achievements.
